AME_atomic_masses_v1.csv contains the evaluations basic information including mass excess, binding energy, beta decay energy, and atomic masses.

AME_atomic_masses_v1_rct1.csv contains the evaluations basic information including mass excess, binding energy, beta decay energy, and atomic masses.

AME_atomic_masses_v1_rct2.csv contains the same data as the previous csv but with the addition of several separation energies and q-values for a variety of reactionc channels. All extracted from AME. 

AME_final_properties_w_NaN.csv and AME_final_properties_no_NaN.csv contain information from all the previous csvs with the addition of a Flag number, filled na by the proton mean.
