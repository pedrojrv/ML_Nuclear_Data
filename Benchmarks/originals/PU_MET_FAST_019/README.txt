Benchmark Description

PU-MET-FAST-019
"Sphere of Plutonium Reflected by Beryllium"
Part of the International Criticality Safety Benchmark Evaluation Project (ICSBEP)

Main materials: Pu-239 (metal), Be, Fe, Cu
Spectrum: fast
Detailed description: 
- sphere of Pu-239 metal, surrounded by beryllium reflector
- reflector is split into two separate halves
- halves are moved together until criticality is reached
- benchmark is modeled at the "critical separation" distance
- assembly rests on a copper cup supported by a steel shaft
- thin steel "diaphragm" (plate) is located between the two reflector halves
- plutonium sphere has a spherical void at its center
- top half of reflector includes a vertical bore hole

Criticality (MCNP): k_eff = 1.0080 +/- 0.0010
(1000 neutrons per cycle, 310 cycles, 10 inactive)
