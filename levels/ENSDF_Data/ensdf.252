252ES c  The |a branching for {+256}Md is adopted as 9.2% {I7} from the         
252ES2c  average of branchings determined: 8.5% {I8} (1970Fi12), 9.9% {I5}      
252ES3c  (1971Ho16). Later measurements by 1993Mo18 yielded 11% {I3}, in        
252ES4c  agreement (within its uncertainty) with the earlier measurements.      
252ES c  A total number of 8 |a-ray energies were measured by 2000Ah02          
252ES2c  (5), 1993Mo18 (7), 1971Ho16 (7) and 1970Fi12 (6).                      
252ES3c  2000Ah02 and 1970Fi12 are in good agreement,                           
252ES4c  and so are also 1993Mo18 and 1971Ho16. However in between the two      
252ES5c  groups the measured E(|a) differ systematically from a few keV for     
252ES6c  the lowest energies, and up to about 100 keV for the highest energies, 
252ES7c  which is more than the reported uncertainties. 2000Ah02 show that the  
252ES8c  discrepancies are due to differences in the calibration standards used 
252ES9c  and by the fact that the |a spectra of 1993Mo18 were measured          
252ES2c  over a large solid angle of |?30% of 4|p and hence they contained      
252ES3c  large amounts of |a-electron sum counts, which distorted the spectral  
252ES4c  shapes.                                                                
252ES c  2000Ah02 used 1991Ry01 recommended energies for |a-energy calibration  
252ES2c  and were presumably less affected by distorting coincidence summing.   
252ES2c  They also report 5 |g rays measured with Ge(Li) detector               
252ES2c  in coincidence with the most intense                                   
252ES2c  |a groups from {+256}Md decay, which are not placed in the level       
252ES2c  scheme of {+252}Es. However, except for the |a-energy distorted        
252ES2c  spectrum, 1993Mo18 contain more detailed information about the         
252ES2c  |a decay of {+256}Md.                                                  
252ES c  The evaluator used the 2000Ah02 and 1993Mo18 |a data and               
252ES3c  used the precisely measured |g rays to test the |a-deduced level       
252ES3c  structure. The best match was obtained using linear regression between 
252ES3c  three |a energies common to both sets (R{+2}=1.0000), and transforming 
252ES3c  the |a energies of 1993Mo18 through the regression line into           
252ES3c  2000Ah02-like values. The agreement is better than taking the average  
252ES3c  of |a energies from 2000Ah02 and 1993Mo18, and much better then using  
252ES3c  each set of |a energies alone.

252MD cN BR        the |a decay/|e decay ratio has been estimated approximately

252MD3cN the 8.42-MeV |a group in their spectrum is from the |e decay           
252MD4cN daughter, {+256}No. Presumably, the 8.43-MeV |a of {+256}Lr was not    
252MD5cN considered; therefore, this branching should be an upper limit.        
252MD6cN In authors' other paper, 1968Fl01, the authors stated that it was      
252MD7cN impossible to determine the branching from their data. The authors     
252MD8cN of 1971Es01 set an upper limit of 20% for an |e branch. It was         
252MD9cN established by 1976BeZY that {+256}Lr decays by electron capture;      
252MD2cN however, its branching was not determined. %|e=15 {I10}, %|a=85 {I10}

252LR2cL The probability for spontaneous fission of {+252}Lr was studied        
252LR3cL by 1976Og02 through {+203,205}Tl({+50}Ti,xn) reactions, and an upper   
252LR4cL limit of 2% was estimated for its spontaneous fission decay.
