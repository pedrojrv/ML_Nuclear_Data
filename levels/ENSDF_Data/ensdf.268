268DB2c  cyclotron. The beam bombarded a {+243}Am target backed by Ti foils     
268DB3c  and including Cu as a catcher material. Reaction products, including   
268DB4c  products of the Cu({+48}Ca,X) reaction were dissolved in concentrated  
268DB5c  HNO{-3}. Group V elements were separated from the solution by          
268DB6c  separating the reaction products from Cu via co-precipitation with     
268DB7c  lanthanum hydroxide and separating Group V elements from lanthanum and 
268DB8c  actinides via sorption from nitric acid. The |a and spontaneous fission
268DB9c  fragments were detected by a module with four identical chambers, each 
268DBAc  containing two semiconductor detectors. The four chambers were         
268DBBc  positioned inside a neutron detector containing 72 {+3}He counters     
268DBCc  positioned in a polyethylene moderator. A similar experiment was also  
268DBDc  performed, involving the same reaction but the reaction products were  
268DBEc  not separated. The detectors were exposed for 72 days, during which    
268DBFc  they were changed at intervals and subjected to physico-chemical       
268DBGc  treatment to develop latent tracks of spontaneous fission fragments.   
268DBHc  Deduced that all spontaneous fission events detected in the            
268DBIc  {+243}Am({+48}Ca,X) reaction were attributable to the decay chain of   
268DBJc  the element 115.

268DB3c  beam energy of 247 MeV. The chemical experiments provided evidence     
268DB4c  that the element was a +5 element, thus supporting the assignment      
268DB5c  as {+268}Db. Measured half-life of {+268}Db from all the events.

268MT5cL assigned all of the decays to one state since the decay time           
268MT6cL distribution exhibited no clear peculiarities. 2004Mo26 note that      
268MT7cL 1995Ho04 observed one fairly long-lived |a-decay (171 ms) with an      
268MT8cL energy 0.16 MeV lower than the other two events. 2004Mo26 also         
268MT9cL observed a 122-ms event but the |a escaped. These two decays may       
268MTAcL indicate an isomeric state in {+268}Mt and, if excluded, the results of
