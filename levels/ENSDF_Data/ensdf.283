283  #c  Note that the TWG and JWP are primarily concerned with the priority of 
283  2c  discovery of an element and not a specific nuclide. The purpose of     
283  3c  this evaluation is to present the "best" set of nuclear properties     
283  4c  for those nuclides reported between A=266 and A=294 based on data      
283  5c  currently available and {Bnot} to establish a priority of discovery for
283  6c  any element.                                                           
283  !c                                                                         
283  #c  It is well known that alpha decay chains seen                          
283  ac  in cold fusion reactions tend to terminate in known mass regions.      
283  2c  The method of |a-|a or |a-SF correlations for identifying the          
283  3c  parent has therefore been used with confidence.                        
283  3c  Experiments carried out with hot fusion reactions,                     
283  4c  result in alpha decay chains beginning and ending with hitherto unknown
283  5c  nuclei, thereby necessitating the use of EVR-|a or EVR-SF correlations 
283  6c  in an attempt to identify the parent and daughters. The latter method  
283  7c  is not as accurate as the first since a greater probability of         
283  8c  randomness is inherant to the technique. As such, independent          
283  9c  verification and confirmation of the data gains added importance.      
283  ac  These facts should be taken into account when considering the suggested
283  ac  properties of nuclei created following a hot fusion reaction as for    
283  ac  the synthesis of Z=114 and above.                                      
283  #c                                                                         
283  #c  Finally, with regard to the some of the                                
283  ac  hot fusion studies conducted by the Dubna-Livermore collaboration,     
283  ac  2004Mo15 have pointed out that mass assignments which are based        
283  ac  on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus may be off by a       
283  ac  single unit. This may also be due in part to uncertainties in the beam 
283  ac  energy and calculated mass excesses of the expected super heavy nuclei.
283  ac  Once again, collateral information is required to establish the charge 
283  ac  and approximate A of the nucleus.                                      
283  #c                                                                         
283  @c  {U|DT{-1/2} Estimates:} Where the half-lives as given by the authors   
283  2c  have not been adopted, the evaluators have used the approximations in  
283  3c  equation 18 of 1984Sc13 for three or more events, assuming an          
283  4c  exponential distribution to estimate the standard uncertainty (68%     
283  5c  confidence level) in T{-1/2}:

283  8c  t{-m}=average mean time, z=1 for a 68% confidence level, and n=number  
283  9c  of events. For one and two events, the exact values given in Table 1   
283  Ac  have been used: |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.543 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=5.79 for n=1 and   
283  Bc  |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.606 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=2.82 for n=2. Note that except for 
283  Cc  the one event |t{-u}/t{-m}, the approximations are accurate within 10%.

283  #c  The parameters were obtained by a fit to 65 even-even nuclei with Z>82 
283  2c  and N>126 (2004OgZZ). Values are revised here in accordance with the   
283  3c  parameter set used in these evaluations. We note that these systematics
283  6c  are only an indication of |a-decay half-lives from the ground state    
283  7c  of a given even-Z(parent), rather than specific to any isotope of the  
283  8c  the element under consideration. The use of this formalism in the      
283  ac  case of odd and odd-odd nuclei is to be taken as qualitative. Some     
283  ac  experimenters ({Ie.g.}, 2004OG03) use T{-1/2}(calc) so derived to      
283  ac  estimate a Hindrance Factor (HF) for a given transition,               
283  ac  attributable to the odd neutron or proton. This quantity is            
283  ac  then given by the ratio of  T|a(expt) to T|a(calc).                    
283  ac  The HF so computed is an approximate indication.

283  @c  {UFusion-Fission Dynamics:} An emerging topic of interest in the       
283  2c  trans-fermium elements is the manifestation of shell effects in the    
283  3c  mass energy distributions (MED) of heavy nuclei as reflected in their  
283  4c  fission and quasi-fission (QF) signatures. Studies of this type are    
283  5c  important as QF is expected to play a greater role on the hindrance of 
283  6c  fusion as one attempts to synthesis heavier nuclei in the approach to  
283  7c  the "island" of stability. An understanding of this mechanism is       
283  8c  necessary to establishing the most favorable reactions for producing   
283  9c  heavy elements. Another unexpected hindrance to fusion was discovered  
283  Ac  by the Canberra group (1998Da24) in much lighter, asymmetric systems   
283  Bc  leading to the formation of CN {+216}Ra*. This was found to be related 
283  Cc  to both the mass asymmetry in the entrance channel as well as the      
283  Dc  on-set of QF. It is thought that (closed) shell structure, as well as  
283  Ec  deformations of target/projectile nuclei and their relative orientation
283  Fc  to each other in the process of CN formation, may also play an         
283  Gc  important role in reducing the probability of forming a compound       
283  Hc  system. In the face of extremely low yields and a steep decrease of    
283  Ic  production cross-sections already in evidence with available stable    
283  Jc  beam-target combinations, the influence of all possible mitigating     
283  Kc  factors must be accurately determined in order to                      
283  Lc  optimize the probability of successful fusion. The formation of a      
283  Mc  super-heavy element (SHE) will be possible only if the di-nucleus      
283  Nc  survives QF going on to form a compact compound system which must then 
283  Oc  face competition from fission.

283  #c  Recently (2004PrZW), a series of experiments designed to investigate   
283  2c  fusion-fission dynamics have been carried out at FLNR-JINR in Dubna    
283  3c  in collaboration with investigators from Belgium, France, and Italy.   
283  4c  Nascent compound nuclei were formed in the range Z=102-122 in the      
283  5c  reactions {+26}Mg+{+248}Cm; {+48}Ca with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+238}U,  
283  6c  {+244}Pu, and {+248}Cm; and {+58}Fe with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+244}Pu, 
283  7c  and {+248}Cm using the U400 cyclotron and the double-arm tof           
283  8c  spectrometer "Corset". These experiments were inspired by              
283  9c  the use of similar targets in the synthesis of Z=112, Z=114, and Z=116 
283  Ac  at Dubna. QF was observed in nuclei {+286}112 to {+296}116 and

283  2c  Two possibilities have been proposed in an attempt to understand the   
283  ac  the {+289}114, {+287}114 observations:                                 
283  #c  (i) that the single {+289}114 chain seen by the DGFRS group            
283  ac  belongs to a rare decay mode originating from                          
283  4c  an isomeric state, or that                                             
283  #c  (ii) the sequence may actually originate from                          
283  6c  {+290}114|){+286}112|){+282}Ds|){+278}Hs (SF) (See {+290}114 Adopted

283  #c  The evaluators believe that further investigations                     
283  ac  are required to support either hypothesis.                             
283  #c  Thus, {+290}114, {+286}112, {+282}Ds and {+278}Hs remain

283  Ac  for {+287}114 as seen by 1999Og07 (data from the VASSILISSA separator)

283  #c  Note that the two papers, 2004Og12 and 2004OgZZ are identical in many

283  #c  2000Ar03, who analyzed the data for the 34-min decay chain of {+289}114
283  3c  (DGFRS data from 1999Og10), {+287}114, and the SF events reported      
283  ac  for {+283}112 (VASSILISSA data from 1999Og05 and 1999Og07),            
283  4c  classified the evidence as being "very weak",                          
283  5c  with no convincing supporting arguments for the possible production of 
283  6c  SHE. We make the following general observations:                       
283  #c                                                                         
283  #c  A total of 46 events (Table IV, 2004Og12), with 5 more events bringing 
283  ac  the total to 51 decays (Table V: 2004OgZZ), have since been reported   
283  ac  by the Dubna-JINR collaborations for all isotopes of                   
283  2c  Z=114. From the largest number of events as reported in  2004OgZZ,     
283  ac  the isotopes observed are {+289}114 (9 events), {+288}114 (16 events), 
283  ac  {+287}114 (15 events) and {+286}114                                    
283  4c  (11 |a + 5 SF events). Taking all the data into consideration,         
283  ac  the |?34 min decay sequence postulated as originating from             
283  5c  a rare decay mode of {+289}114, does not seem very likely.             
283  6c  On the other hand, a statistical analysis by 2000Zl02 suggests that the
283  7c  {+289}114 decays observed are genetically linked                       
283  8c  and not the result of a background decay sequence. These               
283  BC  discrepancies have to be resolved, along with some others.             
283  #c                                                                         
283  #c  {+283}112: The six SF events reported {Ivia} 1999Og05 and 1999Og07 have
283  ac  (see also 2004Og02) with VASSILISSA, have not                          
283  2c  been reproduced in experiments done with DGFRS. There appears to be a  
283  3c  lack of internal consistency through the collective measurements       
283  ac  and the data are inconclusive as pointed                               
283  4c  out by experimenters (reasons given in each paper). Decay properties of
283  5c  parent {+287}114 may be similar to those noted in 2004Og12 but those   
283  6c  of the daughter {+283}112 differ. Also, 2005Gr19 and 2002Lo15 reported 
283  7c  no SF decays or EVR-|a-|a correlations with |Dt(EVR-|a)<20 s or        
283  8c  |Dt(|a-|a)<20 s in any of the {+48}Ca + {+238}U irradiations performed 
283  8c  by them. See {+283}112 Adopted Levels for details.

283  #c  These observations by the experimenters are consistent with the        
283  2c  findings of 2000Ar03 which offer a more detailed analysis. However,    
283  3c  of the various arguments put

283  #c                                                                         
283  #c  1. Total TKE's from the two presumed Z=112 fragments are in each case: 
283  #c  190 MeV and 212 MeV (1999Og05)                                         
283  #c  65 MeV and 170 MeV  (2004Og02)                                         
283  #c  195 MeV and 165 MeV (1999Og07: Daughters of {+287}114)                 
283  #c  TKE for Z=112 (2004Og12; {+282}112 observed as daughter in four events 
283  2c  of nine attributed to {+286}114 (Page 8, Table II(c)) is measured at   
283  3c  213 MeV and 211 MeV (two events, # 1 & 9, registered in both focal     
283  4c  plane and side detectors). With one exception, all the energies        
283  5c  measured in the three papers (1999Og05, 1999Og07, and 2004Og02)        
283  6c  are, in fact, lower than would be expected for this mass range (Z=112  
283  7c  or Hs) as pointed out in 2000Ar03. However, a direct mass analysis     
283  8c  undertaken by the experimenters (2004OG02) of the two SF nuclei (from  
283  9c  the second experiment) after EVR implantation resulted in              
283  ac  A=285.1 {I41}. The result is in agreement with EVR's produced in       
283  bc  {+48}Ca+{+238}U|){+286}112*.

283  #c  2. 2000Ar03 statement that correlations  between the fission events    
283  2c  and preceding signals (recoils/|a's) are random.  Note that a          
283  3c  'backward' analysis of the data was reported in                        
283  4c  1999Og07 and in the other papers. These statements by 2000Ar03 are     
283  5c  evidently in contradiction with those made by the                      
283  6c  experimenters. A more complete analysis would be beneficial.           
283  #c                                                                         
283  #c  3. The experimenters rely on two Z=114 chains (one measured in the     
283  2c  1999Og07); the |?34 min sequence tentatively attributed to {+289}114   
283  ac  quoted from an earlier                                                 
283  3c  experiment (and not seen since) is invoked in support of daughter Z=112
283  4c  assignments. The proposed assignment of Z=114 to both parents may      
283  5c  be incorrect taking into account new data which do not support         
283  6c  these observations and for reasons already mentioned.                  
283  7c  Hence, the Z=112 daughter is also possibly incorrect.                  
283  !c                                                                         
283  #c  CONCLUSIONS:                                                           
283  #c  Properties of Z=112 as proposed in 1999Og05, 1999Og07 and 2004Og02

283  2c  results from the VASSILISSA experiments are at variance with data from 
283  3c  experiments using DGFRS. The latter investigations are done using      
283  4c  more stringent methods, and have greater statistics, offering better   
283  5c  internal consistency. Some obvious discrepancies and other             
283  ac  inconsistencies between the two sets of                                
283  6c  data remain and need to be resolved or adequately explained as does the

283CN C  1999OG05: USING THE REACTION 238U(48CA,XN) ATTEMPTS TO SYNTHESIZE      
283CN2C  NEW ISOTOPES OF Z=112 WERE MADE AT ^DUBNA/^JINR IN COLLABORATION WITH  
283CN3C  ^GSI AND ^RIKEN. AN UPGRADED AND IMPROVED SET-UP WAS NECESSARY FOR THE 
283CN4C  PREPARATION OF THE 48CA BEAM EXTRACTED FROM THE ^U400 CYCLOTRON USED   
283CN5C  WITH THE DETECTION SYSTEM WITH THE ^VASSILISSA SEPARATOR. THE KEY TO   
283CN6C  SYNTHESIS OF Z=112 WAS THE PRODUCTION OF AN INTENSE 48CA ION BEAM      
283CN7C  IN THIS HOT FUSION REACTION. THE ^U400 CYCLOTRON WAS MODIFIED FOR AN   
283CN8C  AXIAL INJECTION OF THE BEAM FROM THE ^ECR-4M ION SOURCE WHICH LEAD TO  
283CN9C  AN INCREASE IN INTENSITY OF A FACTOR OF 2-3 OVER THE PREVIOUS PULSED   
283CNAC  MODE; THE INTENSITY AT TARGET THUS BEING 2.2E+12 PER SEC. TWO BEAM     
283CNBC  ENERGIES WERE USED, 255 MEV 3 AND 262 MEV 3, POST EXTRACTION FROM THE  
283CNCC  CYCLOTRON. THE 0.3 mg/cm{+2} 238U TARGET WAS ENRICHED TO 99.999%. THE  
283CNDC  ^EVR's WERE SEPARATED IN-FLIGHT FROM OTHER REACTION PRODUCTS BY THE    
283CNEC  ELECTROSTATIC RECOIL SEPARATOR ^VASSILISSA (1997YE07). TOF DETECTORS   
283CNFC  WERE USED TO REGISTER ^EVR's AND A POSITION SENSITIVE STRIP DETECTOR   
283CNGC  WAS INSTALLED IN THE FOCAL PLANE OF THE SEPARATOR. THE ENERGY          
283CNHC  RESOLUTION FOR ALPHA PARTICLES WITH ENERGIES OF 6 TO 9 MEV, WAS 20 KEV.
283CNIC  AN ACCURACY OF 1 MICROSEC WAS ACHIEVED FOR RECORDING TIME SIGNALS FROM 
283CNJC  EVENTS. THE ESTIMATED DETECTION EFFICIENCY OF AP 25% WAS ENHANCED BY   
283CNKC  SURROUNDING THE STRIP DETECTOR BY 4 Si DETECTORS. THE ARRAY HAD AN     
283CNLC  EFFICIENCY OF 85% OF 4PI. THE HIGH TOF EFFICIENCY ALLOWED FOR THE      
283CNMC  OBSERVATION OF CLEAN SPECTRA. THE CALCULATED BEAM ENERGIES AT THE      
283CNNC  TARGET CENTER WERE 231 AND 238 MEV CORRESPONDING TO EXCITATION         
283CNOC  ENERGIES OF 33 AND 39 MEV RESPECTIVELY. THE IRRADIATION STARTED        
283CNPC  MARCH 1998 AND PROCEEDED FOR 25 DAYS AT THE LOWER ENERGY WITH A TOTAL  
283CNQC  BEAM DOSE OF 3.5E18 PROJECTILES, AND FOR A FURTHER 15 DAYS AT THE      
283CNRC  HIGHER ENERGY WITH A BEAM  DOSE OF 2.2E+18 IONS. ONLY TWO SF EVENTS    
283CNSC  WERE DETECTED AT THE LOWER ENERGY (231 MEV) NOT ACCOMPANIED BY A TOF   
283CNTC  SIGNAL BUT THE HIGH ENERGY INDICATIVE OF AN IMPLANTED RECOIL.  THE     
283CNUC  ^TKE VALUES FOR THE TWO EVENTS ARE 190 AND 212 MEV. TIME REVERSED      
283CNVC  RECONSTRUCTION OF EVENTS REVEALED THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ALPHA-SF TYPE  
283CNWC  OCCURANCE AT A MEASURED CROSS-SECTION OF 5.0 pb {I+63-32}. THE MEAN    
283CNXC  HALF-LIFE OF THE EVENTS WAS 81 S +147-32. THE ^EVR's BEING FAR FROM THE
283CNYC  REGION OF KNOWN ISOTOPES, COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED MORE CONCLUSIVELY AND
283CNZC  THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE PARENT MAY BE 283CN IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY     
283CNaC  DECAY CHAINS HAVING BEEN OBSERVED, IS BASED ON A VARIETY OF ARGUMENTS  
283CNbC  INCLUDING A COMPARISON WITH EXPECTED THEORETICAL CROSS-SECTIONS. THE   
283CNcC  EXPERIMENTERS HAVE OBSERVED THAT T(SF) OF THE NEW NUCLIDE IS AP 1.5    
283CNdC  MIN BASED ON THESE TWO EVENTS, 3E+5 TIMES LONGER THAN T(ALPHA) OF THE  
283CNeC  LIGHTER NUCLEUS 277CN SYNTHESIZED BY THE ^GSI GROUP AND REPORTED IN    
283CNfC  1996HO13 AND 1999OG07.                                                 
283CN C  1999OG07: AS DAUGHTER OF 28714 IN EXPERIMENTS DONE AT Dubna, WITH FIVE

283CN3C  REACTION 48CA+242PU {IVIA} THE 3{In} CHANNEL WITH A CROSS-SECTION OF   
283CN4C  2.5 pb {I+33-16}. THE 48CA BEAM WAS INJECTED INTO THE ^U400 CYCLOTRON  
283CN5C  AT DUBNA USING SIX ROTATING TARGETS OF 242PU ENRICHED TO 97%. ^EVR's   
283CN6C  WERE SEPARATED BY ^VASSILISSA (1994YE08) IN A SET-UP SIMILAR TO THE ONE
283CN7C  USED IN 1999OG05. THE BEAM ENERGY AT THE CENTER OF THE TARGET WAS      
283CN8C  235 MEV 2, OVER A PERIOD OF 32 DAYS. A TOTAL OF 7.5E18 IONS PASSED     
283CN9C  THROUGH THE TARGET. 4 EVENTS WERE RECORDED WITH E(SF)>100 MEV IN THE   
283CNAC  FRONT DETECTOR: TWO WERE ATTRIBUTED TO SF-ISOMERS OF {+242mf}PU. IN    
283CNBC  THE OTHER EVENTS, SF WAS OBSERVED IN TWO COINCIDENT SIGNALS WITH       
283CNCC  E(TOT)=195 MEV FOR THE FIRST EVENT AND E(TOT)=165 MEV IN THE OTHER.

283CN2C  CHAIN FOR 28914 FROM 1999OG10), CLASSIFYING THE EVIDENCE AS BEING      
283CN3C  "very weak", WITH NO CONVINCING SUPPORTING ARGUMENTS FOR THE POSSIBLE  
283CN4C  PRODUCTION OF ^SHE. 5 DECAY EVENTS DESCRIBED AS BEING UNCORRELATED

283CN C  2001YA19: THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO CHEMICALLY STUDY Z=112 WHICH IS EXPECTED
283CN2C  TO EXHIBIT HIGHER 'VOLATILITY' THAN HG IN GAS CHROMATOGRAPHIC          
283CN3C  EXPERIMENTS WITH AU SURFACES (2004PE06). THE INVESTIGATIONS WERE       
283CN4C  PROMPTED BY THE OBSERVATION OF THE SINGLE 3 MIN, SF DECAY EVENT        
283CN5C  OBSERVED IN 1999OG05. THE REACTION USED WAS 48CA+{+NAT}U{-3}O{-8}      
283CN6C  CONTAINING 100 |mg OF {+NAT}Nd TO ENABLE THE SIMULTANEOUS PRODUCTION   
283CN7C  OF SHORT-LIVED HG NUCLIDES, EXPECTED TO BE THE LIGHTER HOMOLOGUE OF    
283CN8C  Z=112. STARTED IN JANUARY 2000, A 10 DAY IRRADIATION WITH 48CA IONS AT 
283CN9C  A BEAM ENERGY OF 262 MEV (CORRESPONDING TO A CENTER-OF-TARGET ENERGY OF
283CNAC  234 MEV) WITH A BEAM CURRENT OF 0.2-0.4 p|mA RESULTED IN A TOTAL BEAM  
283CNBC  DOSE OF 6.85E+17 IONS. FOLLOWING THE BOMBARDMENTS, BOTH HG AND Z=112   
283CNCC  COULD BE ISOLATED AND TRANSPORTED FROM THE TARGET, THROUGH GASEOUS HE  
283CNDC  TO A ^PIPS (PASSIVATED ION-IMPLANTED PLANAR SILICON) DETECTOR SYSTEM   
283CNEC  WHICH COULD DETECT BOTH SF AND ALPHA'S. TO ENSURE HIGH EFFICIENCY      
283CNFC  ADSORPTION ON THE ^PIPS SURFACES, THEY WERE COATED WITH AU (OR PD).    
283CNGC  BOTH THE 3{IN} AND 4{IN} DE-EXCITATION CHANNELS WERE OBSERVED. RECOILS 
283CNHC  WERE THERMALIZED IN PURE HE AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE AND TRANSPORTED    
283CNIC  THROUGH A 25 M LONG POLYTETRAFLOURETHYLENE (^PTFE) CAPILLARY TO THE    
283CNJC  DETECTORS. DETAILS OF TESTS WITH CARRIER-FREE HG NUCLIDES ALSO         
283CNKC  DESCRIBED. THE ADSORPTION OF HG ATOMS IN 48CA(ND,XN) REACTIONS WAS     
283CNLC  MEASURED BY RECORDING THE KNOWN EA=5.65 MEV  (49 S) FROM 185HG. IF     
283CNMC  INDEED Z=112 BEHAVED LIKE HG, 3.4 +43-22 SF EVENTS COULD HAVE BEEN     
283CNNC  OBSERVED. NO SF EVENTS WERE RECORDED ALTHOUGH THE ATTEMPT SHOWED THAT  
283CNOC  CHEMICAL IDENTIFICATION OF SF NUCLEI PRODUCED WITH pb CROSS-SECTIONS   
283CNPC  IS POSSIBLE.

283CN3C  EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS WAS IMPROVED OVER 1998NIZR TO INCLUDE BETTER    
283CN4C  DETECTORS, DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM {Ietc}. THE 48CA{+10+} BEAM WAS     
283CN5C  PROVIDED AT AN ENERGY OF 243.5 MEV OVER A 5.5 DAY RUN. THE ^EVR's      
283CN6C  WITH AN EXPECTED MAGNETIC RIGIDITY OF AP 39 MEV WERE SEPARATED BY THE  
283CN7C  ^BGS WITH A PARALLEL PLATE AVALANCHE DETECTOR (^PPAC) AT THE FOCAL     
283CN8C  PLANE. A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE DATA RESULTING FROM A BEAM DOSE OF     
283CN9C  1.1E+18 IONS DID NOT REVEAL ANY EVENTS OF INTEREST.                    
283CNAC  NO DATA WAS RECORDED AT THE "one-event" UPPER LIMIT CROSS-SECTION      
283CNBC  OF 1.6 pb FOR ^EVR-SF EVENTS OR AT THE CORRESPONDING CROSS SECTION OF  
283CNCC  1.8 pb FOR ^EVR-|a EVENTS. 2002LO15 CONCLUDE THAT THE CROSS-SECTION    
283CNDC  FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THIS NUCLEUS MUST BE BETTER DETERMINED SINCE     
283CNEC  THE SMALL VALUE OR A POSSIBLE WEAKER ALPHA-DECAY CHANNEL WILL          
283CNFC  CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIFFICULTY IN MEASUREMENT.                           
283CN D  THE "ONE-EVENT" UPPER LIMIT CROSS-SECTION IS WHAT WOULD RESULT IF      
283CNaD  ONE EVENT WAS OBSERVED IN THE EXPERIMENT.                              
283CN C  2003YA22: THE SECOND EXPERIMENT WAS AN IMPROVED VERSION OF 2001YA19.   
283CN2C  THE SET UP EXTENDED TO INVESTIGATE THE ADSORPTION BEHAVIOR OF Z=112    
283CN3C  IN COMPARISON WITH BOTH HG AND RN. SPANNING NOVEMBER-DECEMBER 2001 AT  
283CN4C  ^FLNR/^JINR USING THE ^U400 CYCLOTRON FOR THE SAME REACTION BUT A MUCH 
283CN5C  STRONGER FLUX OF INCIDENT 48CA IONS (0.6 p|mA). THE EARLIER            
283CN6C  ARRANGEMENT WAS EXTENDED TO INCLUDE A 25 M LONG CAPILLARY TUBE         
283CN7C  CONNECTED TO A DETECTOR ARRAY WITH 8 PAIRS OF AU COATED ^PIPS          
283CN8C  DETECTORS TO DETECT HG-LIKE Z=112. FOLLOWING THIS WAS A 5000 CM**3     
283CN9C  IONIZATION CHAMBER TO OBSERVE THE GASEOUS RN-LIKE BEHAVIOR OF Z=112.   
283CNAC  AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT 8 SF EVENTS WERE DETECTED IN THE          
283CNBC  IONIZATION CHAMBER WITH NONE IN THE ^PIPS DETECTORS INDICATING THAT A  
283CNCC  METAL-METAL BOND WITH AU WAS NOT FORMED. WITH AN EXPECTED BACKGROUND   
283CNDC  OF ABOUT 1 EVENT, AND WITH GOOD ARGUMENTS TO RULE OUT OTHER SF         
283CNEC  SOURCES, THE SF EVENTS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO 283CN (2004YA09,2005SCZZ). IT
283CNFC  WAS CONCLUDED THAT Z=112 BEHAVES MORE LIKE A NOBLE GAS SIMILAR TO RN.  
283CNGC  BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF ANY METAL-LIKE EVENT, AN UPPER LIMIT FOR THE   
283CNHC  ADSORPTION ENTHALPY WAS DEDUCED TO BE -|DH{-ads}(112) LE 60 kJ/mol.    
283CNIC  RESULTS ARE INDICATIVE BUT NOT CONCLUSIVE.                             
283CN C  2004GA18 REPORTS RESULTS FROM EXPERIMENTS CARRIED OUT AT GSI IN 2003.  
283CN2C  DONE BY A LARGE INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION CONSISTING OF              
283CN3C  5 COUNTRIES, 10 INSTITUTES. THE REACTION 238U(48CA,3N) WAS STUDIED     
283CN4C  WITH A 1.2 p|mA BEAM SUPPLIED BY ^UNILAC. THE BEAM ENERGY WAS 239 MEV  
283CN5C  AND A TOTAL FLUX OF 2.8E+18 IONS. EMPLOYING THE ^IVO (IN-SITU          
283CN6C  VOLATILIZATION AND ON-LINE DETECTION) (2002DU22) TECHNIQUE WITH ^COLD  
283CN7C  (CRYO ON-LINE DETECTOR) SUCCESSFULLY USED IN Hs EXPERIMENTS, SEVEN     
283CN8C  GE 40 MEV SF EVENTS WERE SEEN WHICH COULD BE 283CN (ASSUMING           
283CN9C  T=3.0 MIN) AT A CROSS-SECTION OF A FEW pb. THESE WERE OBSERVED IN THE  
283CNAC  SAME DETECTORS THAT REGISTERED ISOTOPES OF RN. RESULTS ARE INDICATIVE  
283CNBC  BUT NOT CONCLUSIVE. IMPERFECTIONS IN THE EXPERIMENT HAVE BEEN NOTICED  
283CNCC  AND FURTHER EXPERIMENTS ARE PLANNED.                                   
283CN C  2004OG02: FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS FOR 283CN UNDERTAKEN AT Dubna         
283CN2C  GIVEN THAT T(SF) AP 3 MIN WITH THE CROSS-SECTION OF AP 5 pb IS QUITE   
283CN3C  LARGE. SINCE THE UNAMBIGUOUS IDENTIFICATION OF SF NUCLEI IS DIFFICULT, 
283CN4C  ^VASSILISSA WAS UPGRADED FOR BETTER MASS RESOLUTION BY INCORPORATING   
283CN5C  A NEW DIPOLE MAGNET WITH HIGHER BENDING POWER (SEE DESCRIPTION AND     
283CN6C  REFERENCES CITED) RESULTING IN A TOTAL GEOMETRIC EFFICIENCY OF         
283CN7C  70% OF 4PI WITH AN ADDITIONAL SUPPRESSION OF UNWANTED REACTION         
283CN8C  PRODUCTS BY A FACTOR OF AP 100. THE 48CA BEAM IMPINGED ON THE          
283CN9C  238U TARGET WITH AN INCIDENT ENERGY OF 242 MEV CORRESPONDING TO        
283CNAC  AN EXCITATION ENERGY, ^E*=33 MEV AT THE TARGET CENTER. DURING A PERIOD 
283CNBC  29 DAYS AND A BEAM DOSE OF 5.9E+18 IONS NO SF EVENTS WERE DETECTED.    
283CN5C  DURING THE ANALYSIS OF DATA, LIFETIMES IN THE INTERVAL 5 US TO         
283CN6C  1000 S AND ENERGIES IN THE INTERVAL 8 MEV TO 13 MEV WERE SCANNED. THE  
283CN7C  UPPER LIMIT OF THE CROSS-SECTION WAS DEDUCED TO BE 2.2 pb. A SECOND    
283CN8C  RUN LASTING 15 DAYS WAS CARRIED OUT AT THE HIGHER BEAM ENERGY OF       
283CN9C  245 MEV (^E*=35.5 MEV) WITH A TOTAL BEAM DOSE OF 4.7E+18 PROJECTILES.  
283CNAC  TWO SF SIGNALS WERE DETECTED WITH LIFETIMES OF 3.0 AND 24.3 MIN        
283CNBC  RESPECTIVELY WITH NO ALPHA DECAY EVENTS OBSERVED. MEAN VALUE T FOR A   
283CNCC  TOTAL OF SIX DECAYS INCLUDING TWO AS DAUGHTERS OF 28714 (1999OG07) IS  
283CNDC  5.1 MIN +35-15. THE CROSS-SECTION MEASURED WAS 3.0 pb {I+40-20}.       
283CN C  2004OG07 (SEE ALSO 2004OG05): AS GRANDDAUGHTER OF 29116 FROM ONE EVENT 
283CN2C  RECORDED FROM THE SINGLE ALPHA-DECAY OF 28714. SEE Adopted Levels FOR  
283CN3C  28714 AND 29116 FOR DETAILS OF EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP. EXPERIMENTS WERE   
283CN4C  DONE AT DUBNA IN COLLABORATION WITH ^LLNL. THE CURRENT AND ALL         
283CN5C  SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT USING THE ^DGFRS. ALPHA     
283CN6C  ENERGIES ATTRIBUTED TO THE DECAY OF 283CN WERE AS FOLLOWS:             
283CN7C  EA=9.54 MEV 7 AS ALPHA DECAY DAUGHTER OF 28714;                        
283CN8C  EA=9.55 MEV 7 (EVENT 1) AND                                            
283CN9C  EA=9.52 MEV 7 (EVENT 2) AS ALPHA DECAY GRAND-DAUGHTERS OF 29116. THE   
283CNAC  MEAN ALPHA ENERGY (3 EVENTS) WAS 9.54 MEV AND THE ESTIMATED HALF-LIFE  
283CNBC  WAS GIVEN AS 6.1 S +72-22.                                             
283CN C  2004OG12,2004OGZZ: BY THE COMPLETE FUSION REACTION 238U(48CA,3N) AT    
283CN2C  DUBNA USING THE ^DGFRS. A TOTAL OF 8 DECAY SEQUENCES WERE OBSERVED     
283CN3C  AND ASSIGNED TO Z=112: 7 ^EVR-|a-SF EVENTS SPANNING ABOUT 0.5-6 S      
283CN4C  OBSERVED AT E(BEAM)=230-234 MEV ASSIGNED TO 283CN AND 1 SHORTER        
283CN5C  ^EVR-SF SEQUENCE WITH T(SF)<1 MS OBSERVED AT AN ENERGY OF 240 MEV      
283CN6C  ASSIGNED TO 282CN. THE MEAN ALPHA ENERGY WAS 9.54 MEV IN AGREEMENT     
283CN7C  WITH 2004OG07. A SPECIAL CASE AT A BEAM ENERGY OF 234 MEV WAS RECORDED 
283CN8C  OF THE TYPE ^EVR-|a1-|a2-|a3-|a4-SF ENDING WITH 267RF. ALPHA DECAY IS  
283CN9C  BLOCKED BELOW 279DS WHICH FISSIONS RATHER THAN ALPHA DECAYS (10%). THE 
283CNAC  EVALUATORS SUGGEST THAT THIS LONGER CHAIN WHICH TERMINATES WITH 267RF, 
283CNBC  IF CONFIRMED, MAY BE ONE INCIDENCE OF THIS 10% BRANCH. THE EVENT       
283CNCC  REQUIRES FURTHER INVESTIGATION. NO EVENTS THAT COULD BE ASSIGNED TO    
283CNDC  Z=112 WERE FOUND IN THE REACTION 233U+48CA AT 240 MEV DESPITE AN       
283CNEC  ACCUMULATED BEAM DOSE OF 8E+8 IONS. SEE 2004OG12 AND 2004OGZZ FOR A    
283CNFC  DETAILED DISCUSSION. THESE PAPERS ARE IDENTICAL IN MANY RESPECTS.      
283CNGC  2004OGZZ REPORT MORE STATISTICS SOME CASES.                            
283CN D  THE EXCITATION FUNCTIONS AND DECAY PROPERTIES OF THE SHORTER CHAIN     
283CNaD  MEMBERS  DECAYING BY ^ER-|a-SF IN THE 242PU+48CA REACTION WHEN         
283CNaD  COMPARED AGAINST ^EVR-SF CORRELATIONS IN THE 238U+48CA REACTION        
283CNaD  SHOW THAT THEY MAY ORIGINATE FROM THE  EVEN-EVEN                       
283CNaD  PARENTS  28614 (WITH 282CN AS THE ALPHA-DECAY DAUGHTER)                
283CNaD  AND 282CN RESPECTIVELY.                                                
283CN C  IN THE CASE OF 28714, THE SECOND ALPHA IN THE DECAY CHAIN HAS AN       
283CN2C  ENERGY OF 9.54 MEV 6 WHICH AGREES WELL WITH THE 4 MEASURED             
283CN3C  ALPHAS (2004OG07) IN 11 OUT OF 14 CASES. THE OTHER 3 ALPHA ENERGIES    
283CN4C  ARE 8.94, 9.36 AND 9.32 MEV WHICH 2004OG12 SUGGEST MAY                 
283CN5C  BE INDICATIVE OF TRANSITIONS TO DIFFERENT EXCITED STATES IN THE        
283CN6C  DAUGHTER NUCLEUS 279DS.                                                
283CN C  2004OGZZ NOTE THAT THE MAXIMUM CROSS-SECTION FOR THE 48CA+238U         
283CN2C  REACTION IN THE 3{In} CHANNEL IS 2.5 pb {I+18-11} AT ^E*=35 MEV        
283CN3C  CORRESPONDING TO A BEAM ENERGY OF 231 MEV. THEY SUGGEST THAT THE       
283CN4C  NON-OBSERVATION OF ANY EVENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO Z=112 BY 2002LO15 MAY BE 
283CN5C  DUE TO INSUFFICIENT EXPERIMENTAL SENSITIVITY. THE ONE-EVENT UPPER      
283CN6C  CROSS-SECTION LIMIT SET THEREIN OF 1.6 pb CORRESPONDS TO A STATISTICAL 
283CN7C  UPPER LIMIT OF 2.9 pb WITH 84% CONFIDENCE, ASSUMING ALL PARAMETERS ARE 
283CN8C  CHOSEN OPTIMALLY.

283CN C  FROM THEORY (1995SM05) AND PREVIOUS WORK, PRODUCTION OF ^SHE IN THE    
283CN2C  REGION OF 283CN SHOULD RESULT IN SF DECAY OF EITHER THE PRODUCED       
283CN3C  ISOTOPE OR ONE OF THE DAUGHTER ISOTOPES. THE EXPERIMENT OF 2005GR19 WAS
283CN4C  SENSITIVE TO SF DECAYS WITH LIFETIMES FROM 11 US (15 US AT 230.3 MEV)  
283CN5C  TO AP 1.0E+6 S. NO SF EVENTS WERE OBSERVED IN ANY OF THE 48CA + 238U   
283CN6C  IRRADIATIONS (LE 1.6 pb AND LE 2.0 pb AT 230.3 MEV AND 235.6 MEV,      
283CN7C  RESPECTIVELY; 84% c.i.). SEARCHES FOR POSSIBLE Z=112 DECAY CHAINS WHICH
283CN8C  ARE NOT TERMINATED BY SF DECAY (OR WHERE THE SF LIFETIME IS LONGER THAN
283CN9C  THE DURATION OF THE EXPERIMENT) WERE ALSO PERFORMED. NO

283CN5C  THAT THE RADIOACTIVE PROPERTIES FOR THE CURRENT NUCLEUS AS REPORTED BY 
283CN6C  2004OGZZ, 2004OG12, AND 2004OG07, ALL USING THE ^DGFRS, ARE IN

283CN8C  OBTAINED IN EXPERIMENTS USING THE ^VASSILISSA SEPARATOR. FURTHER       
283CN9C  INVESTIGATIONS MAY BE WARRANTED TO RESOLVE THE EXISTING AMBIGUITIES IN
