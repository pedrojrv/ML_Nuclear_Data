287  #c  Note that the TWG and JWP are primarily concerned with the priority of 
287  2c  discovery of an element and not a specific nuclide. The purpose of     
287  3c  this evaluation is to present the "best" set of nuclear properties     
287  4c  for those nuclides reported between A=266 and A=294 based on data      
287  5c  currently available and {Bnot} to establish a priority of discovery for
287  6c  any element.                                                           
287  !c                                                                         
287  #c  It is well known that alpha decay chains seen                          
287  ac  in cold fusion reactions tend to terminate in known mass regions.      
287  2c  The method of |a-|a or |a-SF correlations for identifying the          
287  3c  parent has therefore been used with confidence.                        
287  3c  Experiments carried out with hot fusion reactions,                     
287  4c  result in alpha decay chains beginning and ending with hitherto unknown
287  5c  nuclei, thereby necessitating the use of EVR-|a or EVR-SF correlations 
287  6c  in an attempt to identify the parent and daughters. The latter method  
287  7c  is not as accurate as the first since a greater probability of         
287  8c  randomness is inherant to the technique. As such, independent          
287  9c  verification and confirmation of the data gains added importance.      
287  ac  These facts should be taken into account when considering the suggested
287  ac  properties of nuclei created following a hot fusion reaction as for    
287  ac  the synthesis of Z=114 and above.                                      
287  #c                                                                         
287  #c  Finally, with regard to the some of the                                
287  ac  hot fusion studies conducted by the Dubna-Livermore collaboration,     
287  ac  2004Mo15 have pointed out that mass assignments which are based        
287  ac  on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus may be off by a       
287  ac  single unit. This may also be due in part to uncertainties in the beam 
287  ac  energy and calculated mass excesses of the expected super heavy nuclei.
287  ac  Once again, collateral information is required to establish the charge 
287  ac  and approximate A of the nucleus.                                      
287  #c                                                                         
287  @c  {U|DT{-1/2} Estimates:} Where the half-lives as given by the authors   
287  2c  have not been adopted, the evaluators have used the approximations in  
287  3c  equation 18 of 1984Sc13 for three or more events, assuming an          
287  4c  exponential distribution to estimate the standard uncertainty (68%     
287  5c  confidence level) in T{-1/2}:

287  8c  t{-m}=average mean time, z=1 for a 68% confidence level, and n=number  
287  9c  of events. For one and two events, the exact values given in Table 1   
287  Ac  have been used: |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.543 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=5.79 for n=1 and   
287  Bc  |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.606 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=2.82 for n=2. Note that except for 
287  Cc  the one event |t{-u}/t{-m}, the approximations are accurate within 10%.

287  #c  The parameters were obtained by a fit to 65 even-even nuclei with Z>82 
287  2c  and N>126 (2004OgZZ). Values are revised here in accordance with the   
287  3c  parameter set used in these evaluations. We note that these systematics
287  6c  are only an indication of |a-decay half-lives from the ground state    
287  7c  of a given even-Z(parent), rather than specific to any isotope of the  
287  8c  the element under consideration. The use of this formalism in the      
287  ac  case of odd and odd-odd nuclei is to be taken as qualitative. Some     
287  ac  experimenters ({Ie.g.}, 2004OG03) use T{-1/2}(calc) so derived to      
287  ac  estimate a Hindrance Factor (HF) for a given transition,               
287  ac  attributable to the odd neutron or proton. This quantity is            
287  ac  then given by the ratio of  T|a(expt) to T|a(calc).                    
287  ac  The HF so computed is an approximate indication.

287  @c  {UFusion-Fission Dynamics:} An emerging topic of interest in the       
287  2c  trans-fermium elements is the manifestation of shell effects in the    
287  3c  mass energy distributions (MED) of heavy nuclei as reflected in their  
287  4c  fission and quasi-fission (QF) signatures. Studies of this type are    
287  5c  important as QF is expected to play a greater role on the hindrance of 
287  6c  fusion as one attempts to synthesis heavier nuclei in the approach to  
287  7c  the "island" of stability. An understanding of this mechanism is       
287  8c  necessary to establishing the most favorable reactions for producing   
287  9c  heavy elements. Another unexpected hindrance to fusion was discovered  
287  Ac  by the Canberra group (1998Da24) in much lighter, asymmetric systems   
287  Bc  leading to the formation of CN {+216}Ra*. This was found to be related 
287  Cc  to both the mass asymmetry in the entrance channel as well as the      
287  Dc  on-set of QF. It is thought that (closed) shell structure, as well as  
287  Ec  deformations of target/projectile nuclei and their relative orientation
287  Fc  to each other in the process of CN formation, may also play an         
287  Gc  important role in reducing the probability of forming a compound       
287  Hc  system. In the face of extremely low yields and a steep decrease of    
287  Ic  production cross-sections already in evidence with available stable    
287  Jc  beam-target combinations, the influence of all possible mitigating     
287  Kc  factors must be accurately determined in order to                      
287  Lc  optimize the probability of successful fusion. The formation of a      
287  Mc  super-heavy element (SHE) will be possible only if the di-nucleus      
287  Nc  survives QF going on to form a compact compound system which must then 
287  Oc  face competition from fission.

287  #c  Recently (2004PrZW), a series of experiments designed to investigate   
287  2c  fusion-fission dynamics have been carried out at FLNR-JINR in Dubna    
287  3c  in collaboration with investigators from Belgium, France, and Italy.   
287  4c  Nascent compound nuclei were formed in the range Z=102-122 in the      
287  5c  reactions {+26}Mg+{+248}Cm; {+48}Ca with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+238}U,  
287  6c  {+244}Pu, and {+248}Cm; and {+58}Fe with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+244}Pu, 
287  7c  and {+248}Cm using the U400 cyclotron and the double-arm tof           
287  8c  spectrometer "Corset". These experiments were inspired by              
287  9c  the use of similar targets in the synthesis of Z=112, Z=114, and Z=116 
287  Ac  at Dubna. QF was observed in nuclei {+286}112 to {+296}116 and

287  2c  Two possibilities have been proposed in an attempt to understand the   
287  ac  the {+289}114, {+287}114 observations:                                 
287  #c  (i) that the single {+289}114 chain seen by the DGFRS group            
287  ac  belongs to a rare decay mode originating from                          
287  4c  an isomeric state, or that                                             
287  #c  (ii) the sequence may actually originate from                          
287  6c  {+290}114|){+286}112|){+282}Ds|){+278}Hs (SF) (See {+290}114 Adopted

287  #c  The evaluators believe that further investigations                     
287  ac  are required to support either hypothesis.                             
287  #c  Thus, {+290}114, {+286}112, {+282}Ds and {+278}Hs remain

287  Ac  for {+287}114 as seen by 1999Og07 (data from the VASSILISSA separator)

287  #c  2000Ar03, who analyzed the data for the 34-min decay chain of {+289}114
287  3c  (DGFRS data from 1999Og10), {+287}114, and the SF events reported      
287  ac  for {+283}112 (VASSILISSA data from 1999Og05 and 1999Og07),            
287  4c  classified the evidence as being "very weak",                          
287  5c  with no convincing supporting arguments for the possible production of 
287  6c  SHE. We make the following general observations:                       
287  #c                                                                         
287  #c  A total of 46 events (Table IV, 2004Og12), with 5 more events bringing 
287  ac  the total to 51 decays (Table V: 2004OgZZ), have since been reported   
287  ac  by the Dubna-JINR collaborations for all isotopes of                   
287  2c  Z=114. From the largest number of events as reported in  2004OgZZ,     
287  ac  the isotopes observed are {+289}114 (9 events), {+288}114 (16 events), 
287  ac  {+287}114 (15 events) and {+286}114                                    
287  4c  (11 |a + 5 SF events). Taking all the data into consideration,         
287  ac  the |?34 min decay sequence postulated as originating from             
287  5c  a rare decay mode of {+289}114, does not seem very likely.             
287  6c  On the other hand, a statistical analysis by 2000Zl02 suggests that the
287  7c  {+289}114 decays observed are genetically linked                       
287  8c  and not the result of a background decay sequence. These               
287  BC  discrepancies have to be resolved, along with some others.             
287  #c                                                                         
287  #c  {+283}112: The six SF events reported {Ivia} 1999Og05 and 1999Og07 have
287  ac  (see also 2004Og02) with VASSILISSA, have not                          
287  2c  been reproduced in experiments done with DGFRS. There appears to be a  
287  3c  lack of internal consistency through the collective measurements       
287  ac  and the data are inconclusive as pointed                               
287  4c  out by experimenters (reasons given in each paper). Decay properties of
287  5c  parent {+287}114 may be similar to those noted in 2004Og12 but those   
287  6c  of the daughter {+283}112 differ. Also, 2005Gr19 and 2002Lo15 reported 
287  7c  no SF decays or EVR-|a-|a correlations with |Dt(EVR-|a)<20 s or        
287  8c  |Dt(|a-|a)<20 s in any of the {+48}Ca + {+238}U irradiations performed

287  #c  These observations by the experimenters are consistent with the        
287  2c  findings of 2000Ar03 which offer a more detailed analysis. However,    
287  3c  of the various arguments put

287  #c                                                                         
287  #c  1. Total TKE's from the two presumed Z=112 fragments are in each case: 
287  #c  190 MeV and 212 MeV (1999Og05)                                         
287  #c  65 MeV and 170 MeV  (2004Og02)                                         
287  #c  195 MeV and 165 MeV (1999Og07: Daughters of {+287}114)                 
287  #c  TKE for Z=112 (2004Og12; {+282}112 observed as daughter in four events 
287  2c  of nine attributed to {+286}114 (Page 8, Table II(c)) is measured at   
287  3c  213 MeV and 211 MeV (two events, # 1 & 9, registered in both focal     
287  4c  plane and side detectors). With one exception, all the energies        
287  5c  measured in the three papers (1999Og05, 1999Og07, and 2004Og02)        
287  6c  are, in fact, lower than would be expected for this mass range (Z=112  
287  7c  or Hs) as pointed out in 2000Ar03. However, a direct mass analysis     
287  8c  undertaken by the experimenters (2004OG02) of the two SF nuclei (from  
287  9c  the second experiment) after EVR implantation resulted in              
287  ac  A=285.1 {I41}. The result is in agreement with EVR's produced in

287  #c  2. 2000Ar03 statement that correlations  between the fission events    
287  2c  and preceding signals (recoils/|a's) are random.  Note that a          
287  3c  'backward' analysis of the data was reported in                        
287  4c  1999Og07 and in the other papers. These statements by 2000Ar03 are     
287  5c  evidently in contradiction with those made by the                      
287  6c  experimenters. A more complete analysis would be beneficial.           
287  #c                                                                         
287  #c  3. The experimenters rely on two Z=114 chains (one measured in the     
287  2c  1999Og07); the |?34 min sequence tentatively attributed to {+289}114   
287  ac  quoted from an earlier                                                 
287  3c  experiment (and not seen since) is invoked in support of daughter Z=112
287  4c  assignments. The proposed assignment of Z=114 to both parents may      
287  5c  be incorrect taking into account new data which do not support         
287  6c  these observations and for reasons already mentioned.                  
287  7c  Hence, the Z=112 daughter is also possibly incorrect.                  
287  !c                                                                         
287  #c  CONCLUSIONS:                                                           
287  #c  Properties of Z=112 as proposed in 1999Og05, 1999Og07 and 2004Og02

287  2c  results from the VASSILISSA experiments are at variance with data from 
287  3c  experiments using DGFRS. The latter investigations are done using      
287  4c  more stringent methods, and have greater statistics, offering better   
287  5c  internal consistency. Some obvious discrepancies and other             
287  ac  inconsistencies between the two sets of                                
287  6c  data remain and need to be resolved or adequately explained as does the

28714 C  1999OG07: THE EXPERIMENT WAS PERFORMED 3 MARCH TO 5 APRIL 1999         
287142C  AT ^JINR/DUBNA WITH THE REACTION 242PU+48CA.                           
287143C  28714 EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED {IVIA} THE 3{IN} CHANNEL WITH A          
287144C  CROSS-SECTION OF 2.5 pb {I+33-16} AS AGAINST AN EXPECTED CROSS-SECTION 
287145C  OF AP 1 pb FOR THIS NUCLEUS IN AN EARLIER ATTEMPT TO SYNTHESIZE Z=114  
287146C  (1999OG10. SEE 28914 Adopted Levels). THE 48CA{+5+} BEAM WAS           
287147C  DELIVERED TO THE ^U400 CYCLOTRON SO THAT E(LAB) AT TARGET-CENTER WAS   
287148C  235 MEV 2. SIX SUCH TARGETS WERE MOUNTED ON A DISK ROTATING AT 2500    
287149C  RPM WITH A BEAM CHOPPER THAT STOPPED THE BEAM FOR 0.6 MS. THE ^EVR'S   
28714AC  WERE SEPARATED IN-FLIGHT BY THE ^VASSILISSA ELECTROSTATIC RECOIL       
28714BC  SEPARATOR (1994YE08). DETECTION OF FULL-ENERGY ALPHA's WAS 85% OF 4PI  
28714CC  WITH A TIME REGISTRATION ACCURACY OF AP 1 US. TWO POSITION CORRELATED  
28714DC  ALPHA-SF SEQUENCES FOR THIS NUCLEUS WERE OBSERVED FOLLOWING 29014 ^CN  
28714EC  DECAY. DEDUCED DECAY PROPERTIES OF THE PARENT 28714: EA=10.29 MEV 2

287142C  SET UP. 28714 IDENTIFIED AT A HIGHER BEAM ENERGY THAN BEFORE AT        
287143C  Dubna WITH 244PU+48CA AT AN ENERGY OF 257 MEV CORRESPONDING TO AN      
287144C  ^E*=40.2 MEV. THIS NUCLEUS IS ALSO CREATED AS THE ALPHA-DECAY DAUGHTER 
287145C  OF 29116 IN THE REACTION 245CM+48CA AT AN ENERGY OF 243 MEV. THE BEAM  
287146C  WAS DELIVERED BY THE ^U400 CYCLOTRON AT THE ^FLNR. THE ^EVR's WERE     
287147C  SEPARATED BY THE ^DGFRS (2000OGZR,2002SU35). THE POSITION AVERAGED     
287148C  DETECTION EFFICIENCY OF ALPHA-DECAYS OF IMPLANTED PRODUCTS WAS 87% OF  
287149C  4PI. EXCITATION FUNCTION MEASUREMENTS WERE DONE WITH HIGHER BEAM       
28714AC  ENERGIES THAN BEFORE IN SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS. AT THE MAXIMUM ENERGY OF  
28714BC  257 MEV (^E*=53 MEV) A SINGLE NEW |a-|a-SF DECAY CHAIN WAS OBSERVED    
28714CC  WITH E(|a1)=10.03 MEV 7 ATTRIBUTED TO 28714, E(|a2)=9.54 MEV 7 FROM    
28714DC  28312, FOLLOWED BY AN SF EVENT WITH E(TOT)=206 MEV FROM 279Ds, ALL     
28714EC  WITHIN A TIME INTERVAL OF ABOUT 10 S. THE PRODUCTION CROSS-SECTION OF  
28714FC  28714 AT THIS ENERGY WAS 1.1 pb {I+26-9}. EVENTS FOLLOWING THE FIRST   
28714GC  ALPHA-DECAY WERE DETECTED WITH THE BEAM OFF TO REDUCE THE BACKGROUND.  
28714HC  THE PROPERTIES COMPARE WELL WITH THE TWO CHAINS ASSIGNED TO 29116      
28714IC  (WHERE 28114 IS THE DAUGHTER) FROM THE 245CM+48CA REACTION AT 243 MEV. 
28714 C  2004OG12,2004OGZZ: EXPERIMENTS DONE AT DUBNA WITH A 242PU TARGET       
287142C  DURING THE PERIOD Sept-Nov 2003 USING THE 48CA BEAM FROM THE ^U400     
287143C  CYCLOTRON AT FOUR BOMBARDING ENERGIES: E(BEAM)=235, 238, 244, AND      
287144C  250 MEV. THE ^EVR's WERE SEPARATED IN-FLIGHT BY ^DGFRS WITH THE        
287145C  TRANSMISSION EFFICIENCY ESTIMATED TO BE 35-40% FOR Z=114 AND 116       
287146C  (2000OGZR,2002SU35). THE SYNTHESIS OF Z=114 WAS ACHIEVED IN THE        
287147C  REACTION 242PU(48CA,XN){+290-x}114. THE CROSS-SECTION FOR 28714 {IVIA} 
287148C  THE 3{In} CHANNEL WAS 3.6 pb {I+34-17}. THE TARGET WAS 99.98% ENRICHED.
287149C  THE TRANSMISSION EFFICIENCY FOR Z=112 AND 114 WAS APPROXIMATELY 40%.   
28714AC  THE BEAM WAS SWITCHED OFF AFTER A RECOIL SIGNAL WAS DETECTED WITHIN THE
28714BC  IMPLANTATION ENERGY AND TOF PARAMETERS EXPECTED FOR Z=114, FOLLOWED BY 
28714CC  AN ALPHA-LIKE SIGNAL OF 9.9 MEV LE EA LE 10.35 MEV IN THE SAME STRIP   
28714DC  WITHIN A 1.4-1.9 mm WIDE POSITION WINDOW AND A TIME INTERVAL OF        
28714EC  |Dt=4 S. FOR ALPHA ENERGIES GE 9.3 MEV, ONLY 22 EVENTS WERE DETECTED   
28714FC  AND 6 WERE ASSIGNED TO 28714. 33 ALPHA-DECAYS WERE SEEN. THE 25 CHAINS 
28714GC  DETECTED AND ASSIGNED TO Z=114 MAY BE  DIVIDED INTO THREE GROUPS, OF   
28714HC  WHICH THE ^ER-|a1-|a2-SF SEQUENCES  (15 MEASUREMENTS) ARE ATTRIBUTED TO
28714IC  28714 IN AGREEMENT WITH THE OBSERVATIONS FROM 2004OG07 (SEE ALSO
