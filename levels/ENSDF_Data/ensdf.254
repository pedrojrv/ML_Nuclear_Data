254  7c  independent experiments, results of which differ significantly,

254FMAc  to the excited states in {+254}Fm, and surmised that the 10-min, 1-    
254FMBc  ground state would populate the known g.s. and the first 2+ state in

254NO2cL 2010He10 at GSI, and by 2010Cl01 at LBNL. Very different decay         
254NO3cL schemes were proposed in the two experiments, although a similar       
254NO4cL rotational band, but with different J|p values and configuration,      
254NO5cL was assigned in both the studies. 2016WaZW conducted an independent    
254NO6cL experiment at Jyvaskyla (JYFL) to resolve the difference between the   
254NO7cL two studies. The author favored the decay scheme given by 2010He10,    
254NO8cL with a possible difference that the 605-keV transition deexcited the   
254NO9cL isomer directly rather than through an intermediate level as           
254NOAcL suggested by 2010He10. However, 2016WaZW concluded with the following  
254NOBcL statement about the 605-keV transition: "The 605 keV rays seen at the  
254NOCcL focal plane in coincidence with the decay of the fast isomer confirm   
254NODcL that there is a transition with this energy in {+254}No somewhere      
254NOEcL between the two isomers, but it does not give any more information     
254NOFcL about where in the level scheme the transition should be placed. Any   
254NOGcL of the level schemes in figure 9.1 is consistent with this             
254NOHcL observation". Evaluator also consulted Prof. R.-D. Herzberg, thesis    
254NOIcL advisor of 2016WaZW, as well as the first author of 2006He19 paper     
254NOJcL for his opinion on the current status of the decay scheme of this      
254NOKcL isomer. Evaluator was advised (ref. e-mail reply of June 19, 2017      
254NOLcL from Prof. Herzberg) that at this time, no definite decay scheme       
254NOMcL could be adopted, and that future experiments with more advanced       
254NONcL detector arrays are needed to investigate the decay scheme between     
254NOOcL the two isomers: 184 |ms and 265 ms. Thus, while the two currently     
254NOPcL proposed decay schemes are presented in this evaluation as separate    
254NOQcL datasets, no decay scheme has been adopted in this dataset.

254NO cL $Based on the possible delayed character of the 605.7-keV transition,  
254NO2cL 2016WaZW proposed that the 184-|ms isomer decays directly through      
254NO3cL this transition, without going through an intermediate level, however, 
254NO4cL the statistics were weak, and this transition possibly mixed with      
254NO5cL a similar energy |g ray in the spectra resulting from {+74}Ge(n,n'|g). 
254NO6cL While negating several observations in 2010Cl01, 2016WaZW also         
254NO7cL suggested that there could be two 605-keV transitions in {+254}No,     
254NO8cL one delayed and the other prompt. 2016WaZW concluded with the following
254NO9cL statement about the 605-keV transition: "The 605 keV rays seen at the  
254NOAcL focal plane in coincidence with the decay of the fast isomer confirm   
254NOBcL that there is a transition with this energy in {+254}No somewhere      
254NOCcL between the two isomers, but it does not give any more information     
254NODcL about where in the level scheme the transition should be placed. Any   
254NOEcL of the level schemes in figure 9.1 is consistent with this             
254NOFcL observation". Further experiments, with better statistics, and perhaps 
254NOGcL better detector technology are needed to confirm the decay scheme of   
254NOHcL the 184-|ms isomer feeding the 265-ms isomer.

254LR c  1985He22, 1999He11: four events at E|g=22.5 {I6} were observed by      
254LR2c  1985He22 in coincidence with 9056 - 9129 |a, attributed to 9078|a      
254LR3c  (corresponding to 9089|a adopted here). The 22.5-keV peak was assigned 
254LR4c  on the basis of its energy to L|b{-4}| x ray, due to L1 conversion of  
254LR5c  a |g deexciting the level populated by 9078|a. This |g transition was  
254LR6c  assumed to be M1, since for an E1 or E2 transition, the L2 conversion  
254LR7c  line would be stronger than the L1 conversion line. If this |g is a    
254LR8c  transition between the 344- and 248-keV levels, E|g|?96 keV. No other  
254LR9c  x-rays or |g transitions were assigned to {+258}Db |a decay.

254RF2c  provided by 88-Inch cyclotron at LBNL. Detected charged particles using
254RF3c  a focal plane detector and a double-sided silicon strip detector.      
254RF4c  Half-life of {+254}Rf and production cross section measured based on   
254RF5c  subsequent |a decay of {+254}Rf.                                       
254RF c  2015Da12: two experiments were performed using {+206}Pb({+50}Ti,2n)    
254RF2c  reaction: 1. E=242.5 MeV {+50}Ti beam produced at ATLAS-ANL facility   
254RF3c  was incident on a 0.5 mg/cm{+2} 99.948% enriched {+206}Pb target.      
254RF4c  Recoiling residues were separated and selected using the Fragment Mass 
254RF5c  Analyzer (FMA) and implanted into a 100 |mm-thick, double-sided silicon
254RF6c  strip detector (DSSD) at the focal plane.                              
254RF7c  Spontaneous-fission (SF) events were identified based on               
254RF8c  spatial and temporal correlations between implanted residues and       
254RF9c  high-energy (>100 MeV) decay events in DSSD. Measured energies of      
254RFAc  reaction products, conversion electrons, implant-decay correlations.   
254RFBc  2. E=244 MeV {+50}Ti beam produced at the LBNL cyclotron facility      
254RFDc  was incident on a 0.5 mg/cm{+2} {+206}Pb target. Recoiling             
254RFEc  residues were separated and selected by the Berkeley Gas-filled        
254RFFc  Separator (BGS) and implanted into three 1-mm-thick, double-sided      
254RFGc  silicon-strip detectors (DSSDs), with emitted |g rays detected with    
254RFHc  a clover HPGe detector behind each DSSD. Measured energies of reaction 
254RFIc  products, E|g, I|g, conversion electrons, implant-decay correlations.  
254RFJc  Deduced evidence and T{-1/2} for two isomers in {+254}Rf using a novel 
254RFKc  approach involving a pulse-shape analysis of data acquired with a      
254RFLc  digital data acquisition system. Comparison with multi-quasiparticle   
254RFMc  calculations. A total of 28 and 723 SF events from {+254}Rf were       
254RFOc  identified in the two experiments, respectively. The two isomers were  
254RFPc  identified based on observed electron-SF and/or electron-electron-SF   
254RFQc  correlations following the decay of the isomers, with 82 electrons     
254RFRc  associated with the shorter-lived 2-qp isomer and 11 electrons with the
254RFSc  longer-lived 4-qp isomer. The absence of sizable fission branches from 
254RFTc  either of the isomers implies unprecedented fission hindrance relative 
254RFUc  to the ground state
