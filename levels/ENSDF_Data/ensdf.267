267  #c  Note that the TWG and JWP are primarily concerned with the priority of 
267  2c  discovery of an element and not a specific nuclide. The purpose of     
267  3c  this evaluation is to present the "best" set of nuclear properties     
267  4c  for those nuclides reported between A=266 and A=294 based on data      
267  5c  currently available and {Bnot} to establish a priority of discovery for
267  6c  any element.                                                           
267  !c                                                                         
267  #c  It is well known that alpha decay chains seen                          
267  ac  in cold fusion reactions tend to terminate in known mass regions.      
267  2c  The method of |a-|a or |a-SF correlations for identifying the          
267  3c  parent has therefore been used with confidence.                        
267  3c  Experiments carried out with hot fusion reactions,                     
267  4c  result in alpha decay chains beginning and ending with hitherto unknown
267  5c  nuclei, thereby necessitating the use of EVR-|a or EVR-SF correlations 
267  6c  in an attempt to identify the parent and daughters. The latter method  
267  7c  is not as accurate as the first since a greater probability of         
267  8c  randomness is inherant to the technique. As such, independent          
267  9c  verification and confirmation of the data gains added importance.      
267  ac  These facts should be taken into account when considering the suggested
267  ac  properties of nuclei created following a hot fusion reaction as for    
267  ac  the synthesis of Z=114 and above.                                      
267  #c                                                                         
267  #c  Finally, with regard to the some of the                                
267  ac  hot fusion studies conducted by the Dubna-Livermore collaboration,     
267  ac  2004Mo15 have pointed out that mass assignments which are based        
267  ac  on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus may be off by a       
267  ac  single unit. This may also be due in part to uncertainties in the beam 
267  ac  energy and calculated mass excesses of the expected super heavy nuclei.
267  ac  Once again, collateral information is required to establish the charge 
267  ac  and approximate A of the nucleus.                                      
267  #c                                                                         
267  @c  {U|DT{-1/2} Estimates:} Where the half-lives as given by the authors   
267  2c  have not been adopted, the evaluators have used the approximations in  
267  3c  equation 18 of 1984Sc13 for three or more events, assuming an          
267  4c  exponential distribution to estimate the standard uncertainty (68%     
267  5c  confidence level) in T{-1/2}:

267  8c  t{-m}=average mean time, z=1 for a 68% confidence level, and n=number  
267  9c  of events. For one and two events, the exact values given in Table 1   
267  Ac  have been used: |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.543 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=5.79 for n=1 and   
267  Bc  |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.606 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=2.82 for n=2. Note that except for 
267  Cc  the one event |t{-u}/t{-m}, the approximations are accurate within 10%.

267  #c  The parameters were obtained by a fit to 65 even-even nuclei with Z>82 
267  2c  and N>126 (2004OgZZ). Values are revised here in accordance with the   
267  3c  parameter set used in these evaluations. We note that these systematics
267  6c  are only an indication of |a-decay half-lives from the ground state    
267  7c  of a given even-Z(parent), rather than specific to any isotope of the  
267  8c  the element under consideration. The use of this formalism in the      
267  ac  case of odd and odd-odd nuclei is to be taken as qualitative. Some     
267  ac  experimenters ({Ie.g.}, 2004OG03) use T{-1/2}(calc) so derived to      
267  ac  estimate a Hindrance Factor (HF) for a given transition,               
267  ac  attributable to the odd neutron or proton. This quantity is            
267  ac  then given by the ratio of  T|a(expt) to T|a(calc).                    
267  ac  The HF so computed is an approximate indication.

267  @c  {UFusion-Fission Dynamics:} An emerging topic of interest in the       
267  2c  trans-fermium elements is the manifestation of shell effects in the    
267  3c  mass energy distributions (MED) of heavy nuclei as reflected in their  
267  4c  fission and quasi-fission (QF) signatures. Studies of this type are    
267  5c  important as QF is expected to play a greater role on the hindrance of 
267  6c  fusion as one attempts to synthesis heavier nuclei in the approach to  
267  7c  the "island" of stability. An understanding of this mechanism is       
267  8c  necessary to establishing the most favorable reactions for producing   
267  9c  heavy elements. Another unexpected hindrance to fusion was discovered  
267  Ac  by the Canberra group (1998Da24) in much lighter, asymmetric systems   
267  Bc  leading to the formation of CN {+216}Ra*. This was found to be related 
267  Cc  to both the mass asymmetry in the entrance channel as well as the      
267  Dc  on-set of QF. It is thought that (closed) shell structure, as well as  
267  Ec  deformations of target/projectile nuclei and their relative orientation
267  Fc  to each other in the process of CN formation, may also play an         
267  Gc  important role in reducing the probability of forming a compound       
267  Hc  system. In the face of extremely low yields and a steep decrease of    
267  Ic  production cross-sections already in evidence with available stable    
267  Jc  beam-target combinations, the influence of all possible mitigating     
267  Kc  factors must be accurately determined in order to                      
267  Lc  optimize the probability of successful fusion. The formation of a      
267  Mc  super-heavy element (SHE) will be possible only if the di-nucleus      
267  Nc  survives QF going on to form a compact compound system which must then 
267  Oc  face competition from fission.

267  #c  Recently (2004PrZW), a series of experiments designed to investigate   
267  2c  fusion-fission dynamics have been carried out at FLNR-JINR in Dubna    
267  3c  in collaboration with investigators from Belgium, France, and Italy.   
267  4c  Nascent compound nuclei were formed in the range Z=102-122 in the      
267  5c  reactions {+26}Mg+{+248}Cm; {+48}Ca with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+238}U,  
267  6c  {+244}Pu, and {+248}Cm; and {+58}Fe with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+244}Pu, 
267  7c  and {+248}Cm using the U400 cyclotron and the double-arm tof           
267  8c  spectrometer "Corset". These experiments were inspired by              
267  9c  the use of similar targets in the synthesis of Z=112, Z=114, and Z=116 
267  Ac  at Dubna. QF was observed in nuclei {+286}112 to {+296}116 and

267  2c  Two possibilities have been proposed in an attempt to understand the   
267  ac  the {+289}114, {+287}114 observations:                                 
267  #c  (i) that the single {+289}114 chain seen by the DGFRS group            
267  ac  belongs to a rare decay mode originating from                          
267  4c  an isomeric state, or that                                             
267  #c  (ii) the sequence may actually originate from                          
267  6c  {+290}114|){+286}112|){+282}Ds|){+278}Hs (SF) (See {+290}114 Adopted

267  #c  The evaluators believe that further investigations                     
267  ac  are required to support either hypothesis.                             
267  #c  Thus, {+290}114, {+286}112, {+282}Ds and {+278}Hs remain

267  Ac  for {+287}114 as seen by 1999Og07 (data from the VASSILISSA separator)

267  #c  Note that the two papers, 2004Og12 and 2004OgZZ are identical in many

267  #c  2000Ar03, who analyzed the data for the 34-min decay chain of {+289}114
267  3c  (DGFRS data from 1999Og10), {+287}114, and the SF events reported      
267  ac  for {+283}112 (VASSILISSA data from 1999Og05 and 1999Og07),            
267  4c  classified the evidence as being "very weak",                          
267  5c  with no convincing supporting arguments for the possible production of 
267  6c  SHE. We make the following general observations:                       
267  #c                                                                         
267  #c  A total of 46 events (Table IV, 2004Og12), with 5 more events bringing 
267  ac  the total to 51 decays (Table V: 2004OgZZ), have since been reported   
267  ac  by the Dubna-JINR collaborations for all isotopes of                   
267  2c  Z=114. From the largest number of events as reported in  2004OgZZ,     
267  ac  the isotopes observed are {+289}114 (9 events), {+288}114 (16 events), 
267  ac  {+287}114 (15 events) and {+286}114                                    
267  4c  (11 |a + 5 SF events). Taking all the data into consideration,         
267  ac  the |?34 min decay sequence postulated as originating from             
267  5c  a rare decay mode of {+289}114, does not seem very likely.             
267  6c  On the other hand, a statistical analysis by 2000Zl02 suggests that the
267  7c  {+289}114 decays observed are genetically linked                       
267  8c  and not the result of a background decay sequence. These               
267  BC  discrepancies have to be resolved, along with some others.             
267  #c                                                                         
267  #c  {+283}112: The six SF events reported {Ivia} 1999Og05 and 1999Og07 have
267  ac  (see also 2004Og02) with VASSILISSA, have not                          
267  2c  been reproduced in experiments done with DGFRS. There appears to be a  
267  3c  lack of internal consistency through the collective measurements       
267  ac  and the data are inconclusive as pointed                               
267  4c  out by experimenters (reasons given in each paper). Decay properties of
267  5c  parent {+287}114 may be similar to those noted in 2004Og12 but those   
267  6c  of the daughter {+283}112 differ. Also, 2005Gr19 and 2002Lo15 reported 
267  7c  no SF decays or EVR-|a-|a correlations with |Dt(EVR-|a)<20 s or        
267  8c  |Dt(|a-|a)<20 s in any of the {+48}Ca + {+238}U irradiations performed 
267  8c  by them. See {+283}112 Adopted Levels for details.

267  #c  These observations by the experimenters are consistent with the        
267  2c  findings of 2000Ar03 which offer a more detailed analysis. However,    
267  3c  of the various arguments put

267  #c                                                                         
267  #c  1. Total TKE's from the two presumed Z=112 fragments are in each case: 
267  #c  190 MeV and 212 MeV (1999Og05)                                         
267  #c  65 MeV and 170 MeV  (2004Og02)                                         
267  #c  195 MeV and 165 MeV (1999Og07: Daughters of {+287}114)                 
267  #c  TKE for Z=112 (2004Og12; {+282}112 observed as daughter in four events 
267  2c  of nine attributed to {+286}114 (Page 8, Table II(c)) is measured at   
267  3c  213 MeV and 211 MeV (two events, # 1 & 9, registered in both focal     
267  4c  plane and side detectors). With one exception, all the energies        
267  5c  measured in the three papers (1999Og05, 1999Og07, and 2004Og02)        
267  6c  are, in fact, lower than would be expected for this mass range (Z=112  
267  7c  or Hs) as pointed out in 2000Ar03. However, a direct mass analysis     
267  8c  undertaken by the experimenters (2004OG02) of the two SF nuclei (from  
267  9c  the second experiment) after EVR implantation resulted in              
267  ac  A=285.1 {I41}. The result is in agreement with EVR's produced in       
267  bc  {+48}Ca+{+238}U|){+286}112*.

267  #c  2. 2000Ar03 statement that correlations  between the fission events    
267  2c  and preceding signals (recoils/|a's) are random.  Note that a          
267  3c  'backward' analysis of the data was reported in                        
267  4c  1999Og07 and in the other papers. These statements by 2000Ar03 are     
267  5c  evidently in contradiction with those made by the                      
267  6c  experimenters. A more complete analysis would be beneficial.           
267  #c                                                                         
267  #c  3. The experimenters rely on two Z=114 chains (one measured in the     
267  2c  1999Og07); the |?34 min sequence tentatively attributed to {+289}114   
267  ac  quoted from an earlier                                                 
267  3c  experiment (and not seen since) is invoked in support of daughter Z=112
267  4c  assignments. The proposed assignment of Z=114 to both parents may      
267  5c  be incorrect taking into account new data which do not support         
267  6c  these observations and for reasons already mentioned.                  
267  7c  Hence, the Z=112 daughter is also possibly incorrect.                  
267  !c                                                                         
267  #c  CONCLUSIONS:                                                           
267  #c  Properties of Z=112 as proposed in 1999Og05, 1999Og07 and 2004Og02

267  2c  results from the VASSILISSA experiments are at variance with data from 
267  3c  experiments using DGFRS. The latter investigations are done using      
267  4c  more stringent methods, and have greater statistics, offering better   
267  5c  internal consistency. Some obvious discrepancies and other             
267  ac  inconsistencies between the two sets of                                
267  6c  data remain and need to be resolved or adequately explained as does the

267RF9C  ALPHA DECAY IS BLOCKED BELOW 279DS WHICH FISSIONS RATHER THAN ALPHA    
267RFAC  DECAYS (%A AP 10). THE EVALUATORS SUGGEST THAT THIS LONGER CHAIN       
267RFBC  WHICH TERMINATES WITH 271SG MAY, IF CONFIRMED, BE ONE INCIDENCE OF THIS
267RFCC  10% BRANCH. THE ALPHA ENERGY FOR 279DS FROM THIS EVENT IS 9.7 MEV 6    
267RFDC  WITH A LIFETIME OF 0.2831 S. ANOTHER EXCEPTION TO THE FISSIONING OF

267RFHC  FROM THIS EVENT IS 9.8 MEV 3 WITH A LIFETIME OF 0.2775 S. ALTHOUGH     
267RFIC  BOTH EXCEPTIONS REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION, THEIR RADIOACTIVE       
267RFJC  PROPERTIES AGREE WELL WITH EACH OTHER AND THE EVALUATORS SUGGEST THAT

267RF9C  IN THE CASE OF 28714, THE SECOND ALPHA IN THE DECAY CHAIN HAS AN       
267RFAC  ENERGY OF 9.54 MEV 6 WHICH AGREES WELL WITH THE FOUR MEASURED

267HS3C  ABOUT 50 MEV TO ALLOW FOR THE EVAPORATION OF 4 OR 5 NEUTRONS REQUIRED

267HSCC  THREE TIME AND POSITION CORRELATED CHAINS OF ALPHA PARTICLE EVENTS

267HS2C  271DS ADOPTED LEVELS FOR EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS. A total number of 38    
267HS3C  ALPHA-decays were measured and assigned to nine decay chains OF DS.    
267HS4C  Decay of 271DS by consistency of lower chain member energies and       
267HS5C  lifetimes with known 255NO, 259RF, and 263SG data.                     
267HS6C  The measured ALPHA energies and emission times are grouped as follows: 
267HS7C  five events with an average energy of E1=10738 KEV 20, two events      
267HS8C  with an average energy of E2=10682 KEV 20, one escape and one event    
267HS9C  with energy E3=10709 KEV 20 with a long life-time of 81 MS             
267HSAC  corresponding to a half-life of 56 MS +270-26.                         
267HSBC  The emission times for the first two groups were                       
267HSCC  0.2-4.4 MS and 81 MS for the last event which 1998HO13 take as being a 
267HSDC  sign of an isomeric state in 271DS. The second member of each chain    
267HSEC  corresponds to decay of 267HS. 1998HO13 also suggest the               
267HSFC  existence of two 267HS daughter states.                                
267HS C  2003GI05: DAUGHTER OF 271DS PRODUCED BY 208PB(64NI,N). Confirmation

267HS3C  Adopted Levels FOR EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS. Two position and time         
267HS4C  correlated event chains were assigned to 271DS. No such event          
267HS5C  sequences were seen at the other two beam energies. The two            
267HS6C  corresponding 267HS ALPHA decay energies originating from 1.6-MS       
267HS7C  271DS were 9.89 MEV (following ALPHA decay) and 9.88 MEV (following    
267HS8C  an escape event) Both these states decay to 0.12-S 263SG with          
267HS9C  life-times of 15 MS and 32 MS, respectively.
