285  #c  Note that the TWG and JWP are primarily concerned with the priority of 
285  2c  discovery of an element and not a specific nuclide. The purpose of     
285  3c  this evaluation is to present the "best" set of nuclear properties     
285  4c  for those nuclides reported between A=266 and A=294 based on data      
285  5c  currently available and {Bnot} to establish a priority of discovery for
285  6c  any element.                                                           
285  !c                                                                         
285  #c  It is well known that alpha decay chains seen                          
285  ac  in cold fusion reactions tend to terminate in known mass regions.      
285  2c  The method of |a-|a or |a-SF correlations for identifying the          
285  3c  parent has therefore been used with confidence.                        
285  3c  Experiments carried out with hot fusion reactions,                     
285  4c  result in alpha decay chains beginning and ending with hitherto unknown
285  5c  nuclei, thereby necessitating the use of EVR-|a or EVR-SF correlations 
285  6c  in an attempt to identify the parent and daughters. The latter method  
285  7c  is not as accurate as the first since a greater probability of         
285  8c  randomness is inherant to the technique. As such, independent          
285  9c  verification and confirmation of the data gains added importance.      
285  ac  These facts should be taken into account when considering the suggested
285  ac  properties of nuclei created following a hot fusion reaction as for    
285  ac  the synthesis of Z=114 and above.                                      
285  #c                                                                         
285  #c  Finally, with regard to the some of the                                
285  ac  hot fusion studies conducted by the Dubna-Livermore collaboration,     
285  ac  2004Mo15 have pointed out that mass assignments which are based        
285  ac  on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus may be off by a       
285  ac  single unit. This may also be due in part to uncertainties in the beam 
285  ac  energy and calculated mass excesses of the expected super heavy nuclei.
285  ac  Once again, collateral information is required to establish the charge 
285  ac  and approximate A of the nucleus.                                      
285  #c                                                                         
285  @c  {U|DT{-1/2} Estimates:} Where the half-lives as given by the authors   
285  2c  have not been adopted, the evaluators have used the approximations in  
285  3c  equation 18 of 1984Sc13 for three or more events, assuming an          
285  4c  exponential distribution to estimate the standard uncertainty (68%     
285  5c  confidence level) in T{-1/2}:

285  8c  t{-m}=average mean time, z=1 for a 68% confidence level, and n=number  
285  9c  of events. For one and two events, the exact values given in Table 1   
285  Ac  have been used: |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.543 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=5.79 for n=1 and   
285  Bc  |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.606 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=2.82 for n=2. Note that except for 
285  Cc  the one event |t{-u}/t{-m}, the approximations are accurate within 10%.

285  #c  The parameters were obtained by a fit to 65 even-even nuclei with Z>82 
285  2c  and N>126 (2004OgZZ). Values are revised here in accordance with the   
285  3c  parameter set used in these evaluations. We note that these systematics
285  6c  are only an indication of |a-decay half-lives from the ground state    
285  7c  of a given even-Z(parent), rather than specific to any isotope of the  
285  8c  the element under consideration. The use of this formalism in the      
285  ac  case of odd and odd-odd nuclei is to be taken as qualitative. Some     
285  ac  experimenters ({Ie.g.}, 2004OG03) use T{-1/2}(calc) so derived to      
285  ac  estimate a Hindrance Factor (HF) for a given transition,               
285  ac  attributable to the odd neutron or proton. This quantity is            
285  ac  then given by the ratio of  T|a(expt) to T|a(calc).                    
285  ac  The HF so computed is an approximate indication.

285  @c  {UFusion-Fission Dynamics:} An emerging topic of interest in the       
285  2c  trans-fermium elements is the manifestation of shell effects in the    
285  3c  mass energy distributions (MED) of heavy nuclei as reflected in their  
285  4c  fission and quasi-fission (QF) signatures. Studies of this type are    
285  5c  important as QF is expected to play a greater role on the hindrance of 
285  6c  fusion as one attempts to synthesis heavier nuclei in the approach to  
285  7c  the "island" of stability. An understanding of this mechanism is       
285  8c  necessary to establishing the most favorable reactions for producing   
285  9c  heavy elements. Another unexpected hindrance to fusion was discovered  
285  Ac  by the Canberra group (1998Da24) in much lighter, asymmetric systems   
285  Bc  leading to the formation of CN {+216}Ra*. This was found to be related 
285  Cc  to both the mass asymmetry in the entrance channel as well as the      
285  Dc  on-set of QF. It is thought that (closed) shell structure, as well as  
285  Ec  deformations of target/projectile nuclei and their relative orientation
285  Fc  to each other in the process of CN formation, may also play an         
285  Gc  important role in reducing the probability of forming a compound       
285  Hc  system. In the face of extremely low yields and a steep decrease of    
285  Ic  production cross-sections already in evidence with available stable    
285  Jc  beam-target combinations, the influence of all possible mitigating     
285  Kc  factors must be accurately determined in order to                      
285  Lc  optimize the probability of successful fusion. The formation of a      
285  Mc  super-heavy element (SHE) will be possible only if the di-nucleus      
285  Nc  survives QF going on to form a compact compound system which must then 
285  Oc  face competition from fission.

285  #c  Recently (2004PrZW), a series of experiments designed to investigate   
285  2c  fusion-fission dynamics have been carried out at FLNR-JINR in Dubna    
285  3c  in collaboration with investigators from Belgium, France, and Italy.   
285  4c  Nascent compound nuclei were formed in the range Z=102-122 in the      
285  5c  reactions {+26}Mg+{+248}Cm; {+48}Ca with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+238}U,  
285  6c  {+244}Pu, and {+248}Cm; and {+58}Fe with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+244}Pu, 
285  7c  and {+248}Cm using the U400 cyclotron and the double-arm tof           
285  8c  spectrometer "Corset". These experiments were inspired by              
285  9c  the use of similar targets in the synthesis of Z=112, Z=114, and Z=116 
285  Ac  at Dubna. QF was observed in nuclei {+286}112 to {+296}116 and

285  2c  Two possibilities have been proposed in an attempt to understand the   
285  ac  the {+289}114, {+287}114 observations:                                 
285  #c  (i) that the single {+289}114 chain seen by the DGFRS group            
285  ac  belongs to a rare decay mode originating from                          
285  4c  an isomeric state, or that                                             
285  #c  (ii) the sequence may actually originate from                          
285  6c  {+290}114|){+286}112|){+282}Ds|){+278}Hs (SF) (See {+290}114 Adopted

285  #c  The evaluators believe that further investigations                     
285  ac  are required to support either hypothesis.                             
285  #c  Thus, {+290}114, {+286}112, {+282}Ds and {+278}Hs remain

285  Ac  for {+287}114 as seen by 1999Og07 (data from the VASSILISSA separator)

285  #c  Note that the two papers, 2004Og12 and 2004OgZZ are identical in many

285  #c  2000Ar03, who analyzed the data for the 34-min decay chain of {+289}114
285  3c  (DGFRS data from 1999Og10), {+287}114, and the SF events reported      
285  ac  for {+283}112 (VASSILISSA data from 1999Og05 and 1999Og07),            
285  4c  classified the evidence as being "very weak",                          
285  5c  with no convincing supporting arguments for the possible production of 
285  6c  SHE. We make the following general observations:                       
285  #c                                                                         
285  #c  A total of 46 events (Table IV, 2004Og12), with 5 more events bringing 
285  ac  the total to 51 decays (Table V: 2004OgZZ), have since been reported   
285  ac  by the Dubna-JINR collaborations for all isotopes of                   
285  2c  Z=114. From the largest number of events as reported in  2004OgZZ,     
285  ac  the isotopes observed are {+289}114 (9 events), {+288}114 (16 events), 
285  ac  {+287}114 (15 events) and {+286}114                                    
285  4c  (11 |a + 5 SF events). Taking all the data into consideration,         
285  ac  the |?34 min decay sequence postulated as originating from             
285  5c  a rare decay mode of {+289}114, does not seem very likely.             
285  6c  On the other hand, a statistical analysis by 2000Zl02 suggests that the
285  7c  {+289}114 decays observed are genetically linked                       
285  8c  and not the result of a background decay sequence. These               
285  BC  discrepancies have to be resolved, along with some others.             
285  #c                                                                         
285  #c  {+283}112: The six SF events reported {Ivia} 1999Og05 and 1999Og07 have
285  ac  (see also 2004Og02) with VASSILISSA, have not                          
285  2c  been reproduced in experiments done with DGFRS. There appears to be a  
285  3c  lack of internal consistency through the collective measurements       
285  ac  and the data are inconclusive as pointed                               
285  4c  out by experimenters (reasons given in each paper). Decay properties of
285  5c  parent {+287}114 may be similar to those noted in 2004Og12 but those   
285  6c  of the daughter {+283}112 differ. Also, 2005Gr19 and 2002Lo15 reported 
285  7c  no SF decays or EVR-|a-|a correlations with |Dt(EVR-|a)<20 s or        
285  8c  |Dt(|a-|a)<20 s in any of the {+48}Ca + {+238}U irradiations performed 
285  8c  by them. See {+283}112 Adopted Levels for details.

285  #c  These observations by the experimenters are consistent with the        
285  2c  findings of 2000Ar03 which offer a more detailed analysis. However,    
285  3c  of the various arguments put

285  #c                                                                         
285  #c  1. Total TKE's from the two presumed Z=112 fragments are in each case: 
285  #c  190 MeV and 212 MeV (1999Og05)                                         
285  #c  65 MeV and 170 MeV  (2004Og02)                                         
285  #c  195 MeV and 165 MeV (1999Og07: Daughters of {+287}114)                 
285  #c  TKE for Z=112 (2004Og12; {+282}112 observed as daughter in four events 
285  2c  of nine attributed to {+286}114 (Page 8, Table II(c)) is measured at   
285  3c  213 MeV and 211 MeV (two events, # 1 & 9, registered in both focal     
285  4c  plane and side detectors). With one exception, all the energies        
285  5c  measured in the three papers (1999Og05, 1999Og07, and 2004Og02)        
285  6c  are, in fact, lower than would be expected for this mass range (Z=112  
285  7c  or Hs) as pointed out in 2000Ar03. However, a direct mass analysis     
285  8c  undertaken by the experimenters (2004OG02) of the two SF nuclei (from  
285  9c  the second experiment) after EVR implantation resulted in              
285  ac  A=285.1 {I41}. The result is in agreement with EVR's produced in       
285  bc  {+48}Ca+{+238}U|){+286}112*.

285  #c  2. 2000Ar03 statement that correlations  between the fission events    
285  2c  and preceding signals (recoils/|a's) are random.  Note that a          
285  3c  'backward' analysis of the data was reported in                        
285  4c  1999Og07 and in the other papers. These statements by 2000Ar03 are     
285  5c  evidently in contradiction with those made by the                      
285  6c  experimenters. A more complete analysis would be beneficial.           
285  #c                                                                         
285  #c  3. The experimenters rely on two Z=114 chains (one measured in the     
285  2c  1999Og07); the |?34 min sequence tentatively attributed to {+289}114   
285  ac  quoted from an earlier                                                 
285  3c  experiment (and not seen since) is invoked in support of daughter Z=112
285  4c  assignments. The proposed assignment of Z=114 to both parents may      
285  5c  be incorrect taking into account new data which do not support         
285  6c  these observations and for reasons already mentioned.                  
285  7c  Hence, the Z=112 daughter is also possibly incorrect.                  
285  !c                                                                         
285  #c  CONCLUSIONS:                                                           
285  #c  Properties of Z=112 as proposed in 1999Og05, 1999Og07 and 2004Og02

285  2c  results from the VASSILISSA experiments are at variance with data from 
285  3c  experiments using DGFRS. The latter investigations are done using      
285  4c  more stringent methods, and have greater statistics, offering better   
285  5c  internal consistency. Some obvious discrepancies and other             
285  ac  inconsistencies between the two sets of                                
285  6c  data remain and need to be resolved or adequately explained as does the

285CN2C  CHANNEL USING 244PU+48CA AT 236 MEV PROVIDED BY THE ^U400 CYCLOTRON    
285CN3C  IN NOVEMBER-DECEMBER 1998. ^EVR's WERE SEPARATED  BY THE ^DGFRS        
285CN4C  (1993LAZS). 40% OF THE RECOILING Z=114 NUCLEI EXPECTED TO BE IMPLANTED 
285CN4C  IN THE FOCAL PLANE DETECTOR. THREE SF EVENTS SEEN: ONE EVENT ASSIGNED  
285CN5C  TO 0.9 MS {+244mf}AM, THE PRODUCT OF TRANSFER REACTIONS. SECOND EVENT: 
285CN6C  INFORMATION WAS LOST. THIRD SF EVENT WAS RESOLVED INTO A               
285CN7C  POSITION-CORRELATED DECAY CHAIN WITH ^E1=9.71 MEV, t1=30.4 S; 285CN:

285CNAC  1-10 WERE ASSUMED FOR ALPHA-DECAYS OF ODD-N NUCLEI. TENTATIVE          
285CNBC  ASSIGNMENT OF PARENT 28914 MADE IN AGREEMENT WITH CALCULATIONS BY      
285CNCC  Smolanczuk (1997SM03) AND CORRESPONDING TO A CROSS-SECTION OF          
285CNDC  1 pb. THIS DECAY SEQUENCE AND ALL CONSTITUENT ASSIGNMENTS ARE          
285CNEC  CONSIDERED TENTATIVE BY THE EVALUATORS.                                
285CN D  2000FI12 OBSERVED THAT A POSSIBLE ASSIGNMENT TO 29013 OR 287CN         
285CN2D  DECAY CHAIN CANNOT BE RULED OUT. THE PROBABILITY OF THIS BEING AN      
285CN3D  ACCIDENTAL DECAY CHAIN WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 1E-5 BY THE AUTHORS.        
285CN C  2000OG05: EXPERIMENTS CONTINUED AT DUBNA WITH 244PU+48CA AT 236 MEV AS 
285CN2C  BEFORE BUT IMPROVED SENSITIVITY OF >2 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE OVER PREVIOUS
285CN3C  ATTEMPTS, FOR PICOBARN CROSS-SECTIONS EXPECTED IN THE PRODUCTION OF    
285CN4C  Z=114. THESE EXPERIMENTS WERE DONE FROM JUNE TO OCTOBER 1999           
285CN5C  INCORPORATING AN UPGRADED DATA ACQUISITION                             
285CN6C  SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWED FOR A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TARGET SECTOR       
285CN7C  GIVING RISE TO A SPECIFIC RECOIL AND THE EXCITATION ENERGY AT TARGET   
285CN8C  CENTER FOR THE SAME EVENT. THE ^U400 CYCLOTRON WAS USED WITH ^DGFRS    
285CN9C  (2000OGZR, 1993LAZS). OBSERVED TWO IDENTICAL THREE-MEMBER DECAY        
285CNAC  SEQUENCES CORRESPONDING TO TWO SF EVENTS AT A 48CA BEAM ENERGY OF      
285CNBC  237.6 AND 237.0 MEV AT TARGET-CENTER CORRESPONDING TO EXCITATION       
285CN3C  ENERGIES OF 33.6-39.7 MEV AND 33.2-39.1 MEV OF THE {+292}114 ^CN,      
285CN4C  RESPECTIVELY. TWO SF EVENTS WERE RECORDED AS COINCIDENT SIGNALS WITH   
285CN5C  ENERGIES ^E1(TOT)=221 MEV AND ^E2(TOT)=213 MEV. UPON THE TIME-REVERSED 
285CN6C  RECONSTRUCTION OF ALL DATA, TWO ALPHA DECAY CHAINS, CONSISTENT WITH    
285CN7C  EACH OTHER WERE REPORTED AND THOUGHT TO ORIGINATE FROM 28814 {IVIA} THE
285CN8C  4{IN} CHANNEL. THESE WERE REASSIGNED TO 28914 IN 2004OG07 AND 2004OG12.
285CN9C  THE DECAYS PROCEED AS FOLLOWS: E1(|a)=9.87 MEV, t1=0.77 S;             
285CNAC  E2(|a)=9.21 MEV, t2=10.34 S; E3(SF-TOT)=221 MEV, t(SF)=14.26 S FOR THE 
285CNBC  FIRST CHAIN AND E1(|a)=9.80 MEV, t1=4.58 S; E2(|a)=9.13 MEV,           
285CNCC  t2=18.01 S; E3(SF-TOT)=213 MEV, t(SF)=7.44 S FOR THE SECOND CHAIN      
285CNDC  RESPECTIVELY. THE SECOND EVENT IN EACH CHAIN IS 285CN. IT WAS OBSERVED 
285CNEC  THAT LIFE-TIMES OF NUCLEI Z GE DS WERE CONSIDERABLY INCREASED OVER     
285CNFC  PREDICTIONS WITH INCREASING NEUTRON NUMBER. THE EXPERIMENTS WERE       
285CNGC  COLLECTIVELY OFFERED AS PROOF OF ENHANCED STABILITY IN THE REGION

285CN C  2004OG07, 2004OG12: SEE 28914 Adopted Levels FOR DETAILS. A SERIES OF  
285CN2C  EXPERIMENTS USING MORE STRINGENT METHODS (1992BA77,2004OG05) WERE      
285CN3C  CARRIED OUT SINCE ALL THESE CHAINS PASSED THROUGH AND ENDED IN         
285CN4C  HITHERTO UNKNOWN REGIONS. BOMBARDING ENERGIES OF 48CA ON 244PU WERE    
285CN5C  HIGHER THAN THOSE USED EARLIER. AT 243 MEV TWO DECAY CHAINS WERE       
285CN6C  OBSERVED OF THE TYPE |a-|a-SF. A TENTATIVE (DUE TO THE HIGH RANDOMNESS 
285CN7C  PROBABILITY OF ABOUT 40%) ASSIGNMENT OF 28914 WAS MADE; TENTATIVE      
285CN8C  ALPHA-DECAY DAUGHTER 285CN (BEAM OFF CONDITION) WITH EA=9.16 MEV 6.    
285CN9C  THREE OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS WITH A SMALLER PROBABILITY OF RANDOMNESS OF 
285CNAC  18%, 2% AND 6% WERE DETECTED AT THIS ENERGY. TWO SUCH IDENTICAL DECAY  
285CNBC  CHAINS HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SEEN IN 2000OG05 AND 2000OG07 AT THE LOWER  
285CNCC  ENERGY OF 236 MEV (SEE THE 29316 Adopted Levels) WITH THE REACTION     
285CNDC  248CM+48CA. AT AN ENERGY OF 250 MEV, ONE MORE SUCH EVENT WAS OBSERVED; 
285CNEC  NONE AT 257 MEV.

285CN2C  S PRODUCED IN THE REACTION 248CM+48CA AT E=247 MEV. THE EXPERIMENTERS  
285CN3C  NOTE THAT THESE CHAINS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OBSERVED AT A LOWER ENERGY 
285CN4C  IN 2001OG01, 2001OG06, AND ALSO DISCUSSED IN 2002OG09.                 
285CN5C  IN BOTH CASES THE PARENT WAS 29316 AND |a3 WAS ATTRIBUTED TO 285CN.    
285CN6C  A TOTAL OF 10 (ALPHA) DECAY EVENTS WERE CONSIDERED IN THE ESTIMATION   
285CN7C  OF THE HALF-LIFE OF T1/2=29 S +13-7. 2004OG12 AND 2004OGZZ ARE
