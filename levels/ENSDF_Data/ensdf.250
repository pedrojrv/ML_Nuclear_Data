250  2c  with mass numbers A=250, 254, 258, 262 and 266 is presented. Various   
250  3c  decay and reaction data are evaluated and compared. Adopted data,      
250  4c  levels, spin, parity and configuration assignments are given. When     
250  5c  there are insufficient data, expectations from systematics of nuclear  
250  6c  properties are given, results from theoretical calculations are        
250  7c  quoted.  Unexpected or discrepant experimental results are also

250U 5c  followed by chemical extraction and purification. The isotopic         
250U 6c  composition of Pu, Am and Cm fractions were determined by using mass   
250U 7c  spectrometers, while the abundances of all the transcurium elements

250BK CL           ANOTHER REASON FOR ADOPTING THIS ORDER IS THAT IF THE

250BK c  A partial level scheme is given as shown in 1982HoZE. 600 |g           
250BK2c  rays were observed (1982HoZE), 43 of them have been placed.            
250BK c  The measured I|g's were not listed. However, on their level scheme,    
250BK2c  |G of |g's are shown as proportional to their intensities.             
250BK c  Placements of a number of transitions in the level scheme              
250BK2c  are not consistent with the proposed configurations for levels.        
250BK3c  If the level scheme is correct, the states must include large          
250BK4c  admixtures of other configurations in addition to those proposed. See  
250BK5c  also adopted levels, gammas section for additional comments.           
250BK c  Authors' interpretation of their data is in progress                   
250BK2c  (priv. comm. R. W. Hoff). Until completion of their analysis, the      
250BK2c  unpublished interpretation of data presented here should be taken as   
250BK4c  tentative. The levels at 406, 526, 552 and 566 keV and their           
250BK5c  configuration assignments are from 1985HoZM.                           
250BK cG E         Taken from the decay scheme shown in 1982HoZE. No

250BK cG M         Deduced by 1982HoZE from ce data. Multipolarities for        
250BK2cG 40% of the observed gammas were determined; however, data are not      
250BK3cG given, only their conclusions are shown on their level scheme. In the

250CF4CL CROSS SECTION IN POPULATION OF THE 3- MEMBER SUGGESTS                  
250CF5CL OCTUPOLE-VIBRATIONAL STATE. THE BAND WAS POPULATED IN (A,T) REACTION
