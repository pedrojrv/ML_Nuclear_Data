289  #c  Note that the TWG and JWP are primarily concerned with the priority of 
289  2c  discovery of an element and not a specific nuclide. The purpose of     
289  3c  this evaluation is to present the "best" set of nuclear properties     
289  4c  for those nuclides reported between A=266 and A=294 based on data      
289  5c  currently available and {Bnot} to establish a priority of discovery for
289  6c  any element.                                                           
289  !c                                                                         
289  #c  It is well known that alpha decay chains seen                          
289  ac  in cold fusion reactions tend to terminate in known mass regions.      
289  2c  The method of |a-|a or |a-SF correlations for identifying the          
289  3c  parent has therefore been used with confidence.                        
289  3c  Experiments carried out with hot fusion reactions,                     
289  4c  result in alpha decay chains beginning and ending with hitherto unknown
289  5c  nuclei, thereby necessitating the use of EVR-|a or EVR-SF correlations 
289  6c  in an attempt to identify the parent and daughters. The latter method  
289  7c  is not as accurate as the first since a greater probability of         
289  8c  randomness is inherant to the technique. As such, independent          
289  9c  verification and confirmation of the data gains added importance.      
289  ac  These facts should be taken into account when considering the suggested
289  ac  properties of nuclei created following a hot fusion reaction as for    
289  ac  the synthesis of Z=114 and above.                                      
289  #c                                                                         
289  #c  Finally, with regard to the some of the                                
289  ac  hot fusion studies conducted by the Dubna-Livermore collaboration,     
289  ac  2004Mo15 have pointed out that mass assignments which are based        
289  ac  on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus may be off by a       
289  ac  single unit. This may also be due in part to uncertainties in the beam 
289  ac  energy and calculated mass excesses of the expected super heavy nuclei.
289  ac  Once again, collateral information is required to establish the charge 
289  ac  and approximate A of the nucleus.                                      
289  #c                                                                         
289  @c  {U|DT{-1/2} Estimates:} Where the half-lives as given by the authors   
289  2c  have not been adopted, the evaluators have used the approximations in  
289  3c  equation 18 of 1984Sc13 for three or more events, assuming an          
289  4c  exponential distribution to estimate the standard uncertainty (68%     
289  5c  confidence level) in T{-1/2}:

289  8c  t{-m}=average mean time, z=1 for a 68% confidence level, and n=number  
289  9c  of events. For one and two events, the exact values given in Table 1   
289  Ac  have been used: |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.543 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=5.79 for n=1 and   
289  Bc  |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.606 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=2.82 for n=2. Note that except for 
289  Cc  the one event |t{-u}/t{-m}, the approximations are accurate within 10%.

289  #c  The parameters were obtained by a fit to 65 even-even nuclei with Z>82 
289  2c  and N>126 (2004OgZZ). Values are revised here in accordance with the   
289  3c  parameter set used in these evaluations. We note that these systematics
289  6c  are only an indication of |a-decay half-lives from the ground state    
289  7c  of a given even-Z(parent), rather than specific to any isotope of the  
289  8c  the element under consideration. The use of this formalism in the      
289  ac  case of odd and odd-odd nuclei is to be taken as qualitative. Some     
289  ac  experimenters ({Ie.g.}, 2004OG03) use T{-1/2}(calc) so derived to      
289  ac  estimate a Hindrance Factor (HF) for a given transition,               
289  ac  attributable to the odd neutron or proton. This quantity is            
289  ac  then given by the ratio of  T|a(expt) to T|a(calc).                    
289  ac  The HF so computed is an approximate indication.

289  @c  {UFusion-Fission Dynamics:} An emerging topic of interest in the       
289  2c  trans-fermium elements is the manifestation of shell effects in the    
289  3c  mass energy distributions (MED) of heavy nuclei as reflected in their  
289  4c  fission and quasi-fission (QF) signatures. Studies of this type are    
289  5c  important as QF is expected to play a greater role on the hindrance of 
289  6c  fusion as one attempts to synthesis heavier nuclei in the approach to  
289  7c  the "island" of stability. An understanding of this mechanism is       
289  8c  necessary to establishing the most favorable reactions for producing   
289  9c  heavy elements. Another unexpected hindrance to fusion was discovered  
289  Ac  by the Canberra group (1998Da24) in much lighter, asymmetric systems   
289  Bc  leading to the formation of CN {+216}Ra*. This was found to be related 
289  Cc  to both the mass asymmetry in the entrance channel as well as the      
289  Dc  on-set of QF. It is thought that (closed) shell structure, as well as  
289  Ec  deformations of target/projectile nuclei and their relative orientation
289  Fc  to each other in the process of CN formation, may also play an         
289  Gc  important role in reducing the probability of forming a compound       
289  Hc  system. In the face of extremely low yields and a steep decrease of    
289  Ic  production cross-sections already in evidence with available stable    
289  Jc  beam-target combinations, the influence of all possible mitigating     
289  Kc  factors must be accurately determined in order to                      
289  Lc  optimize the probability of successful fusion. The formation of a      
289  Mc  super-heavy element (SHE) will be possible only if the di-nucleus      
289  Nc  survives QF going on to form a compact compound system which must then 
289  Oc  face competition from fission.

289  #c  Recently (2004PrZW), a series of experiments designed to investigate   
289  2c  fusion-fission dynamics have been carried out at FLNR-JINR in Dubna    
289  3c  in collaboration with investigators from Belgium, France, and Italy.   
289  4c  Nascent compound nuclei were formed in the range Z=102-122 in the      
289  5c  reactions {+26}Mg+{+248}Cm; {+48}Ca with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+238}U,  
289  6c  {+244}Pu, and {+248}Cm; and {+58}Fe with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+244}Pu, 
289  7c  and {+248}Cm using the U400 cyclotron and the double-arm tof           
289  8c  spectrometer "Corset". These experiments were inspired by              
289  9c  the use of similar targets in the synthesis of Z=112, Z=114, and Z=116 
289  Ac  at Dubna. QF was observed in nuclei {+286}112 to {+296}116 and

289  2c  Two possibilities have been proposed in an attempt to understand the   
289  ac  the {+289}114, {+287}114 observations:                                 
289  #c  (i) that the single {+289}114 chain seen by the DGFRS group            
289  ac  belongs to a rare decay mode originating from                          
289  4c  an isomeric state, or that                                             
289  #c  (ii) the sequence may actually originate from                          
289  6c  {+290}114|){+286}112|){+282}Ds|){+278}Hs (SF) (See {+290}114 Adopted

289  #c  The evaluators believe that further investigations                     
289  ac  are required to support either hypothesis.                             
289  #c  Thus, {+290}114, {+286}112, {+282}Ds and {+278}Hs remain

289  Ac  for {+287}114 as seen by 1999Og07 (data from the VASSILISSA separator)

289  #c  Note that the two papers, 2004Og12 and 2004OgZZ are identical in many

289  #c  2000Ar03, who analyzed the data for the 34-min decay chain of {+289}114
289  3c  (DGFRS data from 1999Og10), {+287}114, and the SF events reported      
289  ac  for {+283}112 (VASSILISSA data from 1999Og05 and 1999Og07),            
289  4c  classified the evidence as being "very weak",                          
289  5c  with no convincing supporting arguments for the possible production of 
289  6c  SHE. We make the following general observations:                       
289  #c                                                                         
289  #c  A total of 46 events (Table IV, 2004Og12), with 5 more events bringing 
289  ac  the total to 51 decays (Table V: 2004OgZZ), have since been reported   
289  ac  by the Dubna-JINR collaborations for all isotopes of                   
289  2c  Z=114. From the largest number of events as reported in  2004OgZZ,     
289  ac  the isotopes observed are {+289}114 (9 events), {+288}114 (16 events), 
289  ac  {+287}114 (15 events) and {+286}114                                    
289  4c  (11 |a + 5 SF events). Taking all the data into consideration,         
289  ac  the |?34 min decay sequence postulated as originating from             
289  5c  a rare decay mode of {+289}114, does not seem very likely.             
289  6c  On the other hand, a statistical analysis by 2000Zl02 suggests that the
289  7c  {+289}114 decays observed are genetically linked                       
289  8c  and not the result of a background decay sequence. These               
289  BC  discrepancies have to be resolved, along with some others.             
289  #c                                                                         
289  #c  {+283}112: The six SF events reported {Ivia} 1999Og05 and 1999Og07 have
289  ac  (see also 2004Og02) with VASSILISSA, have not                          
289  2c  been reproduced in experiments done with DGFRS. There appears to be a  
289  3c  lack of internal consistency through the collective measurements       
289  ac  and the data are inconclusive as pointed                               
289  4c  out by experimenters (reasons given in each paper). Decay properties of
289  5c  parent {+287}114 may be similar to those noted in 2004Og12 but those   
289  6c  of the daughter {+283}112 differ. Also, 2005Gr19 and 2002Lo15 reported 
289  7c  no SF decays or EVR-|a-|a correlations with |Dt(EVR-|a)<20 s or        
289  8c  |Dt(|a-|a)<20 s in any of the {+48}Ca + {+238}U irradiations performed 
289  8c  by them. See {+283}112 Adopted Levels for details.

289  #c  These observations by the experimenters are consistent with the        
289  2c  findings of 2000Ar03 which offer a more detailed analysis. However,    
289  3c  of the various arguments put

289  #c                                                                         
289  #c  1. Total TKE's from the two presumed Z=112 fragments are in each case: 
289  #c  190 MeV and 212 MeV (1999Og05)                                         
289  #c  65 MeV and 170 MeV  (2004Og02)                                         
289  #c  195 MeV and 165 MeV (1999Og07: Daughters of {+287}114)                 
289  #c  TKE for Z=112 (2004Og12; {+282}112 observed as daughter in four events 
289  2c  of nine attributed to {+286}114 (Page 8, Table II(c)) is measured at   
289  3c  213 MeV and 211 MeV (two events, # 1 & 9, registered in both focal     
289  4c  plane and side detectors). With one exception, all the energies        
289  5c  measured in the three papers (1999Og05, 1999Og07, and 2004Og02)        
289  6c  are, in fact, lower than would be expected for this mass range (Z=112  
289  7c  or Hs) as pointed out in 2000Ar03. However, a direct mass analysis     
289  8c  undertaken by the experimenters (2004OG02) of the two SF nuclei (from  
289  9c  the second experiment) after EVR implantation resulted in              
289  ac  A=285.1 {I41}. The result is in agreement with EVR's produced in       
289  bc  {+48}Ca+{+238}U|){+286}112*.

289  #c  2. 2000Ar03 statement that correlations  between the fission events    
289  2c  and preceding signals (recoils/|a's) are random.  Note that a          
289  3c  'backward' analysis of the data was reported in                        
289  4c  1999Og07 and in the other papers. These statements by 2000Ar03 are     
289  5c  evidently in contradiction with those made by the                      
289  6c  experimenters. A more complete analysis would be beneficial.           
289  #c                                                                         
289  #c  3. The experimenters rely on two Z=114 chains (one measured in the     
289  2c  1999Og07); the |?34 min sequence tentatively attributed to {+289}114   
289  ac  quoted from an earlier                                                 
289  3c  experiment (and not seen since) is invoked in support of daughter Z=112
289  4c  assignments. The proposed assignment of Z=114 to both parents may      
289  5c  be incorrect taking into account new data which do not support         
289  6c  these observations and for reasons already mentioned.                  
289  7c  Hence, the Z=112 daughter is also possibly incorrect.                  
289  !c                                                                         
289  #c  CONCLUSIONS:                                                           
289  #c  Properties of Z=112 as proposed in 1999Og05, 1999Og07 and 2004Og02

289  2c  results from the VASSILISSA experiments are at variance with data from 
289  3c  experiments using DGFRS. The latter investigations are done using      
289  4c  more stringent methods, and have greater statistics, offering better   
289  5c  internal consistency. Some obvious discrepancies and other             
289  ac  inconsistencies between the two sets of                                
289  6c  data remain and need to be resolved or adequately explained as does the

28914EC  IN AGREEMENT WITH CALCULATIONS BY Smolanczuk (1997SM03),               
28914FC  CORRESPONDING TO A CROSS-SECTION OF 1 pb. THE CHAIN STARTING WITH THE  
28914GC  RATHER LONG t=30.4 S DECAY AND TAKING ABOUT 34 MIN IN TOTAL FOR ALL    
28914HC  3 ALPHA-DECAYS + SF, WAS CONSIDERED A GOOD {ICANDIDATE} FOR 28914

289145C  FROM JUNE TO OCTOBER 1999 INCORPORATING AN UPGRADED DATA ACQUISITION   
289146C  SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWED FOR A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TARGET SECTOR       
289147C  GIVING RISE TO A SPECIFIC RECOIL AND THE EXCITATION ENERGY AT TARGET   
289148C  CENTER FOR THE SAME EVENT. THE ^U400 CYCLOTRON WAS USED WITH ^DGFRS    
289149C  (2000OGZR,1993LAZS). OBSERVED TWO IDENTICAL THREE-MEMBER DECAY         
28914AC  SEQUENCES CORRESPONDING TO TWO SF EVENTS AT A 48CA BEAM ENERGY OF      
28914BC  237.6 AND 237.0 MEV AT TARGET-CENTER CORRESPONDING TO EXCITATION       
28914CC  ENERGIES OF 33.6-39.7 MEV AND 33.2-39.1 MEV OF THE {+292}114 ^CN,      
28914DC  RESPECTIVELY. TWO SF EVENTS WERE RECORDED AS COINCIDENT SIGNALS WITH   
28914EC  ENERGIES Z=1(TOT)=221 MEV AND ^E2(TOT)=213 MEV. UPON THE TIME-REVERSED 
28914FC  RECONSTRUCTION OF ALL DATA, TWO ALPHA DECAY CHAINS, CONSISTENT WITH    
28914HC  EACH OTHER WERE REPORTED AND THOUGHT TO ORIGINATE FROM  28814 {Ivia}   
28914IC  THE 4{In} CHANNEL. THESE WERE REASSIGNED TO 28914 BY 2004OG07 AND      
28914JC  2004OG12.

289146C  STRINGENT METHODS (SEE 1992BA77,2004OG05) WERE CARRIED OUT SINCE ALL   
289147C  THESE CHAINS PASSED THROUGH AND ENDED IN HITHERTO UNKNOWN REGIONS.     
289148C  BOMBARDING ENERGIES OF 48CA ON 244PU WERE HIGHER THAN THOSE USED       
289149C  EARLIER. THE 48CA{+5} IONS WERE DELIVERED BY THE ^U400 CYCLOTRON       
28914AC  AT ^FLNR-^JINR OPERATED WITH THE ^ECR-4M ION SOURCE. THE ^EVR'S WERE   
28914BC  SEPARATED IN-FLIGHT FROM THE SCATTERED PARTICLES AND REACTION PRODUCTS 
28914CC  BY THE ^DGFRS (2000OGZR, 2002SU35). THE TRANSMISSION EFFICIENCY FOR    
28914DC  Z=114 AND Z=116 NUCLEI WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 35-40%. THE POSITION        
28914EC  AVERAGED DETECTION EFFICIENCY FOR THE |a-DECAYS OF IMPLANTED NUCLEI    
28914FC  WAS 87% OF 4PI. AT 243 MEV TWO DECAY CHAINS WERE OBSERVED OF THE TYPE  
28914GC  |a1-|a2-SF. A TENTATIVE (DUE TO THE HIGH RANDOMNESS PROBABILITY OF     
28914HC  ABOUT 40%) ASSIGNMENT OF 28914 WAS MADE FOR THE EVENT WITH             
28914aC  EA=9.9 MEV 9 AND t=6.3 S.                                              
28914HC  THREE OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS WITH A SMALLER PROBABILITY OF RANDOMNESS OF 
28914JC  18%, 2% AND 6% WERE DETECTED AT THIS ENERGY. TWO SUCH IDENTICAL DECAY  
28914KC  CHAINS HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SEEN BY 2000OG05 AND 2000OG07 AT THE LOWER  
28914LC  ENERGY OF 236 MEV THEN THOUGHT TO ORIGINATE FROM 28814,                
28914aC  AND THREE SUCH DECAY CHAINS AFTER THE |a-DECAY OF THE                  
28914MC  PARENT (Z=116) WERE SEEN IN 2001OG01, 2001OG06 AND 2002OG09 (SEE THE   
28914NC  29316 Adopted Levels) WITH THE REACTION 248CM+48CA PREVIOUSLY ASCRIBED 
28914aC  TO 29216. IN THIS WORK, AT AN ENERGY OF 250 MEV, ONE MORE SUCH EVENT   
28914OC  WAS OBSERVED FOR WHICH THE ASSIGNMENT TO 28914 IN NOT CONCLUSIVE BUT   
28914aC  CANNOT BE EXCLUDED. NO EVENTS WERE RECORDED AT 257 MEV. THESE          
28914PC  MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE WITHIN AN ENERGY INTERVAL OF 235-250 MEV

28914SC  IN ADDITION, AT 243 MEV 7 NEW DECAY CHAINS WERE SEEN NOT SIMILAR TO    
28914TC  ANY OTHERS SEEN EARLIER (28814). THESE WERE OF THE TYPE |a-SF, DETECTED
28914UC  WITHIN ONE SECOND OF THE EVR IMPLANTATION.  ALSO, FOUR MORE SUCH

28915 c  The randomness factors (1984Sc13) were determined by simulating each   
28915ac  of the five observed decay chains using extended intervals of time     
28915ac  (|Dt |> 5T{-1/2}), energy and position (exceeding 4.7 standard         
28915ac  deviations). The estimates are 6|*10{+-6}, 10{+-3}, 10{+-5},           
28915ac  3|*10{+-11} and 3|*10{+-11}.

289152c  (2010Og01). The evaluator suggests that the                            
289155c  properties attributed to {+293}117 and its daughters should be         
289156c  considered as tentative until confirmed independently. The half-lives  
28915ac  and Q(|a) are averaged values derived by the experimenters             
28915ac  from the events observed for which details are not provided.
