256MD2cL J=0,1 for the {+256}Md g.s. From the available states in the

256MD4cL odd-neutron state, and analogy to {+255}Md suggests |p7/2[514] orbital 
256MD5cL for the odd-proton state. From the Gallagher-Moszkowski rule, the

256MD2cL |p3/2[521], |n7/2[613] configuration. Since an |a transition           
256MD3cL from J|p=0- to J|p=5- is forbidden, J|p({+256}Md g.s.)=1- of K=0 has   
256MD4cL been suggested. Inversion of 1- and 0- states has also been assigned   
256MD5cL for other K=0 bands (for example in {+242}Am g.s.).

256LR cL $The |a decay/|e decay ratio has been estimated approximately          
256LR2cL only. The authors of 1968Fl08 deduced the |e branch as about 30%, if   
256LR3cL the 8.42-MeV |a group in their spectrum is from the |e decay           
256LR4cL daughter, {+256}No. Presumably, the 8.43-MeV |a of {+256}Lr was not    
256LR5cL considered; therefore, this branching should be an upper limit.        
256LR6cL In authors' other paper, 1968Fl01, the authors stated that it was      
256LR7cL impossible to determine the branching from their data. The authors     
256LR8cL of 1971Es01 set an upper limit of 20% for an |e branch. It was

256DB2c  activity in {+209}Bi({+49}Ti,2n); measured half-life from SF           
256DB3c  and |a-decay curves. According to results of experiments in 2001He35,  
256DB4c  the SF activity reported by 1983OgZX was most likely from {+256}Rf

256DB6c  evidence for |e decay mode of {+256}Db resulting in {+256}Rf which     
256DB7c  decays primarily by SF decay mode, and that is the SF activity which
