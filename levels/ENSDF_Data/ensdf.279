279  #c  Note that the TWG and JWP are primarily concerned with the priority of 
279  2c  discovery of an element and not a specific nuclide. The purpose of     
279  3c  this evaluation is to present the "best" set of nuclear properties     
279  4c  for those nuclides reported between A=266 and A=294 based on data      
279  5c  currently available and {Bnot} to establish a priority of discovery for
279  6c  any element.                                                           
279  !c                                                                         
279  #c  It is well known that alpha decay chains seen                          
279  ac  in cold fusion reactions tend to terminate in known mass regions.      
279  2c  The method of |a-|a or |a-SF correlations for identifying the          
279  3c  parent has therefore been used with confidence.                        
279  3c  Experiments carried out with hot fusion reactions,                     
279  4c  result in alpha decay chains beginning and ending with hitherto unknown
279  5c  nuclei, thereby necessitating the use of EVR-|a or EVR-SF correlations 
279  6c  in an attempt to identify the parent and daughters. The latter method  
279  7c  is not as accurate as the first since a greater probability of         
279  8c  randomness is inherant to the technique. As such, independent          
279  9c  verification and confirmation of the data gains added importance.      
279  ac  These facts should be taken into account when considering the suggested
279  ac  properties of nuclei created following a hot fusion reaction as for    
279  ac  the synthesis of Z=114 and above.                                      
279  #c                                                                         
279  #c  Finally, with regard to the some of the                                
279  ac  hot fusion studies conducted by the Dubna-Livermore collaboration,     
279  ac  2004Mo15 have pointed out that mass assignments which are based        
279  ac  on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus may be off by a       
279  ac  single unit. This may also be due in part to uncertainties in the beam 
279  ac  energy and calculated mass excesses of the expected super heavy nuclei.
279  ac  Once again, collateral information is required to establish the charge 
279  ac  and approximate A of the nucleus.                                      
279  #c                                                                         
279  @c  {U|DT{-1/2} Estimates:} Where the half-lives as given by the authors   
279  2c  have not been adopted, the evaluators have used the approximations in  
279  3c  equation 18 of 1984Sc13 for three or more events, assuming an          
279  4c  exponential distribution to estimate the standard uncertainty (68%     
279  5c  confidence level) in T{-1/2}:

279  8c  t{-m}=average mean time, z=1 for a 68% confidence level, and n=number  
279  9c  of events. For one and two events, the exact values given in Table 1   
279  Ac  have been used: |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.543 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=5.79 for n=1 and   
279  Bc  |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.606 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=2.82 for n=2. Note that except for 
279  Cc  the one event |t{-u}/t{-m}, the approximations are accurate within 10%.

279  #c  The parameters were obtained by a fit to 65 even-even nuclei with Z>82 
279  2c  and N>126 (2004OgZZ). Values are revised here in accordance with the   
279  3c  parameter set used in these evaluations. We note that these systematics
279  6c  are only an indication of |a-decay half-lives from the ground state    
279  7c  of a given even-Z(parent), rather than specific to any isotope of the  
279  8c  the element under consideration. The use of this formalism in the      
279  ac  case of odd and odd-odd nuclei is to be taken as qualitative. Some     
279  ac  experimenters ({Ie.g.}, 2004OG03) use T{-1/2}(calc) so derived to      
279  ac  estimate a Hindrance Factor (HF) for a given transition,               
279  ac  attributable to the odd neutron or proton. This quantity is            
279  ac  then given by the ratio of  T|a(expt) to T|a(calc).                    
279  ac  The HF so computed is an approximate indication.

279  @c  {UFusion-Fission Dynamics:} An emerging topic of interest in the       
279  2c  trans-fermium elements is the manifestation of shell effects in the    
279  3c  mass energy distributions (MED) of heavy nuclei as reflected in their  
279  4c  fission and quasi-fission (QF) signatures. Studies of this type are    
279  5c  important as QF is expected to play a greater role on the hindrance of 
279  6c  fusion as one attempts to synthesis heavier nuclei in the approach to  
279  7c  the "island" of stability. An understanding of this mechanism is       
279  8c  necessary to establishing the most favorable reactions for producing   
279  9c  heavy elements. Another unexpected hindrance to fusion was discovered  
279  Ac  by the Canberra group (1998Da24) in much lighter, asymmetric systems   
279  Bc  leading to the formation of CN {+216}Ra*. This was found to be related 
279  Cc  to both the mass asymmetry in the entrance channel as well as the      
279  Dc  on-set of QF. It is thought that (closed) shell structure, as well as  
279  Ec  deformations of target/projectile nuclei and their relative orientation
279  Fc  to each other in the process of CN formation, may also play an         
279  Gc  important role in reducing the probability of forming a compound       
279  Hc  system. In the face of extremely low yields and a steep decrease of    
279  Ic  production cross-sections already in evidence with available stable    
279  Jc  beam-target combinations, the influence of all possible mitigating     
279  Kc  factors must be accurately determined in order to                      
279  Lc  optimize the probability of successful fusion. The formation of a      
279  Mc  super-heavy element (SHE) will be possible only if the di-nucleus      
279  Nc  survives QF going on to form a compact compound system which must then 
279  Oc  face competition from fission.

279  #c  Recently (2004PrZW), a series of experiments designed to investigate   
279  2c  fusion-fission dynamics have been carried out at FLNR-JINR in Dubna    
279  3c  in collaboration with investigators from Belgium, France, and Italy.   
279  4c  Nascent compound nuclei were formed in the range Z=102-122 in the      
279  5c  reactions {+26}Mg+{+248}Cm; {+48}Ca with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+238}U,  
279  6c  {+244}Pu, and {+248}Cm; and {+58}Fe with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+244}Pu, 
279  7c  and {+248}Cm using the U400 cyclotron and the double-arm tof           
279  8c  spectrometer "Corset". These experiments were inspired by              
279  9c  the use of similar targets in the synthesis of Z=112, Z=114, and Z=116 
279  Ac  at Dubna. QF was observed in nuclei {+286}112 to {+296}116 and

279  2c  Two possibilities have been proposed in an attempt to understand the   
279  ac  the {+289}114, {+287}114 observations:                                 
279  #c  (i) that the single {+289}114 chain seen by the DGFRS group            
279  ac  belongs to a rare decay mode originating from                          
279  4c  an isomeric state, or that                                             
279  #c  (ii) the sequence may actually originate from                          
279  6c  {+290}114|){+286}112|){+282}Ds|){+278}Hs (SF) (See {+290}114 Adopted

279  #c  The evaluators believe that further investigations                     
279  ac  are required to support either hypothesis.                             
279  #c  Thus, {+290}114, {+286}112, {+282}Ds and {+278}Hs remain

279  Ac  for {+287}114 as seen by 1999Og07 (data from the VASSILISSA separator)

279  #c  Note that the two papers, 2004Og12 and 2004OgZZ are identical in many

279  #c  2000Ar03, who analyzed the data for the 34-min decay chain of {+289}114
279  3c  (DGFRS data from 1999Og10), {+287}114, and the SF events reported      
279  ac  for {+283}112 (VASSILISSA data from 1999Og05 and 1999Og07),            
279  4c  classified the evidence as being "very weak",                          
279  5c  with no convincing supporting arguments for the possible production of 
279  6c  SHE. We make the following general observations:                       
279  #c                                                                         
279  #c  A total of 46 events (Table IV, 2004Og12), with 5 more events bringing 
279  ac  the total to 51 decays (Table V: 2004OgZZ), have since been reported   
279  ac  by the Dubna-JINR collaborations for all isotopes of                   
279  2c  Z=114. From the largest number of events as reported in  2004OgZZ,     
279  ac  the isotopes observed are {+289}114 (9 events), {+288}114 (16 events), 
279  ac  {+287}114 (15 events) and {+286}114                                    
279  4c  (11 |a + 5 SF events). Taking all the data into consideration,         
279  ac  the |?34 min decay sequence postulated as originating from             
279  5c  a rare decay mode of {+289}114, does not seem very likely.             
279  6c  On the other hand, a statistical analysis by 2000Zl02 suggests that the
279  7c  {+289}114 decays observed are genetically linked                       
279  8c  and not the result of a background decay sequence. These               
279  BC  discrepancies have to be resolved, along with some others.             
279  #c                                                                         
279  #c  {+283}112: The six SF events reported {Ivia} 1999Og05 and 1999Og07 have
279  ac  (see also 2004Og02) with VASSILISSA, have not                          
279  2c  been reproduced in experiments done with DGFRS. There appears to be a  
279  3c  lack of internal consistency through the collective measurements       
279  ac  and the data are inconclusive as pointed                               
279  4c  out by experimenters (reasons given in each paper). Decay properties of
279  5c  parent {+287}114 may be similar to those noted in 2004Og12 but those   
279  6c  of the daughter {+283}112 differ. Also, 2005Gr19 and 2002Lo15 reported 
279  7c  no SF decays or EVR-|a-|a correlations with |Dt(EVR-|a)<20 s or        
279  8c  |Dt(|a-|a)<20 s in any of the {+48}Ca + {+238}U irradiations performed 
279  8c  by them. See {+283}112 Adopted Levels for details.

279  #c  These observations by the experimenters are consistent with the        
279  2c  findings of 2000Ar03 which offer a more detailed analysis. However,    
279  3c  of the various arguments put

279  #c                                                                         
279  #c  1. Total TKE's from the two presumed Z=112 fragments are in each case: 
279  #c  190 MeV and 212 MeV (1999Og05)                                         
279  #c  65 MeV and 170 MeV  (2004Og02)                                         
279  #c  195 MeV and 165 MeV (1999Og07: Daughters of {+287}114)                 
279  #c  TKE for Z=112 (2004Og12; {+282}112 observed as daughter in four events 
279  2c  of nine attributed to {+286}114 (Page 8, Table II(c)) is measured at   
279  3c  213 MeV and 211 MeV (two events, # 1 & 9, registered in both focal     
279  4c  plane and side detectors). With one exception, all the energies        
279  5c  measured in the three papers (1999Og05, 1999Og07, and 2004Og02)        
279  6c  are, in fact, lower than would be expected for this mass range (Z=112  
279  7c  or Hs) as pointed out in 2000Ar03. However, a direct mass analysis     
279  8c  undertaken by the experimenters (2004OG02) of the two SF nuclei (from  
279  9c  the second experiment) after EVR implantation resulted in              
279  ac  A=285.1 {I41}. The result is in agreement with EVR's produced in       
279  bc  {+48}Ca+{+238}U|){+286}112*.

279  #c  2. 2000Ar03 statement that correlations  between the fission events    
279  2c  and preceding signals (recoils/|a's) are random.  Note that a          
279  3c  'backward' analysis of the data was reported in                        
279  4c  1999Og07 and in the other papers. These statements by 2000Ar03 are     
279  5c  evidently in contradiction with those made by the                      
279  6c  experimenters. A more complete analysis would be beneficial.           
279  #c                                                                         
279  #c  3. The experimenters rely on two Z=114 chains (one measured in the     
279  2c  1999Og07); the |?34 min sequence tentatively attributed to {+289}114   
279  ac  quoted from an earlier                                                 
279  3c  experiment (and not seen since) is invoked in support of daughter Z=112
279  4c  assignments. The proposed assignment of Z=114 to both parents may      
279  5c  be incorrect taking into account new data which do not support         
279  6c  these observations and for reasons already mentioned.                  
279  7c  Hence, the Z=112 daughter is also possibly incorrect.                  
279  !c                                                                         
279  #c  CONCLUSIONS:                                                           
279  #c  Properties of Z=112 as proposed in 1999Og05, 1999Og07 and 2004Og02

279  2c  results from the VASSILISSA experiments are at variance with data from 
279  3c  experiments using DGFRS. The latter investigations are done using      
279  4c  more stringent methods, and have greater statistics, offering better   
279  5c  internal consistency. Some obvious discrepancies and other             
279  ac  inconsistencies between the two sets of                                
279  6c  data remain and need to be resolved or adequately explained as does the

279DS5C  THE CURRENT AND ALL SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT         
279DS6C  USING THE ^DGFRS. THE SYNTHESIS OF 28714 WAS DONE USING A 244PU TARGET 
279DS7C  AT A 48CA BEAM ENERGY OF 257 MEV IN THE 5{In} EVAPORATION CHANNEL.     
279DS8C  IN THE CASE OF 29116 (1{In}), A 245CM TARGET WAS USED AND BOMBARDED

279DS8C  ^EVR-|a1-|a2-|a3-|a4-SF WARRANTS MENTION. GENERALLY,                   
279DS9C  ALPHA DECAY IS BLOCKED BELOW 279DS WHICH FISSIONS RATHER THAN ALPHA    
279DSAC  DECAYS (%A AP 10). THE EVALUATORS SUGGEST THAT THIS LONGER CHAIN       
279DSBC  WHICH TERMINATES WITH 271SG MAY, IF CONFIRMED, BE ONE INCIDENCE OF THIS
279DSCC  10% BRANCH. THE ALPHA ENERGY FOR 279DS FROM THIS EVENT IS 9.7 MEV 6    
279DSDC  WITH A LIFETIME OF 0.2831 S. ANOTHER EXCEPTION TO THE FISSIONING OF    
279DSEC  279DS APPEARS IN THE CASE OF A SIMILAR ^EVR-|a1-|a2-|a3-|a4-SF EVENT   
279DSFC  ORIGINATING FROM 28312 IN THE 238U REACTION AT 234 MEV. HERE, THE      
279DSGC  SEQUENCE ENDS WITH THE FISSION OF 267RF. THE ALPHA ENERGY FOR 279DS    
279DSHC  FROM THIS EVENT IS 9.8 MEV 3 WITH A LIFETIME OF 0.2775 S. ALTHOUGH     
279DSIC  BOTH EXCEPTIONS REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION, THEIR RADIOACTIVE       
279DSJC  PROPERTIES AGREE WELL WITH EACH OTHER AND THE EVALUATORS SUGGEST THAT  
279DSKC  IF CONFIRMED, THEY COULD REPRESENT THE 10% ALPHA DECAY BRANCH FOR      
279DSLC  279DS.                                                                 
279DS C  28312 WAS CREATED IN THE COMPLETE FUSION REACTION 238U(48CA,4N) AT

279DS7C  AGREEMENT WITH 2004OG07. NO EVENTS THAT COULD BE ASSIGNED TO Z=112 WERE
279DS8C  FOUND IN THE REACTION 233U+48CA AT 240 MEV DESPITE AN ACCUMULATED BEAM 
279DS9C  DOSE OF 8E+8 IONS. SEE 2004OG12 AND 2004OGZZ FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION.

279DS5C  PARTICULAR, THE DECAY PROPERTIES OF 28312 ARE CONSISTENT THROUGH       
279DS6C  THE VARIOUS MEASUREMENTS USING THE ^DGFRS, INDEPENDENTLY OF WHETHER    
279DS7C  THEY WERE OBSERVED AS PRIMARY NUCLEI OR AS ALPHA DECAY DAUGHTERS OF    
279DS8C  PARENTS ONE (Z=114) OR TWO (Z=116) 'LEVELS' UP.                        
279DS9C  IN THE CASE OF 28714, THE SECOND ALPHA IN THE DECAY CHAIN HAS AN       
279DSAC  ENERGY OF 9.54 MEV 6 WHICH AGREES WELL WITH THE FOUR MEASURED          
279DSBC  ALPHAS (2004OG07, 2004OG12) IN 11 OUT OF 14 CASES. THE OTHER THREE     
279DSCC  ALPHA ENERGIES ARE 8.94, 9.36 AND 9.32 MEV WHICH THE EXPERIMENTERS     
279DSDC  SUGGEST MAY BE INDICATIVE OF TRANSITIONS TO DIFFERENT EXCITED STATES   
279DSEC  IN THE DAUGHTER NUCLEUS 279DS. NOTE THAT 2005GR19 DID NOT OBSERVE ANY  
279DSFC  SF DECAYS OR ^EVR-ALPHA-ALPHA CORRELATIONS IN ANY 48CA + 238U
