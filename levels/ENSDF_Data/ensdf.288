288FL2c  extracted from an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source and    
288FL3c  accelerated by the universal linear accelerator (UNILAC) at the GSI.   
288FL4c  Target=438 |mg/cm{+2} {+244}Pu enriched to 97.9% purity backed with    
288FL5c  a 2.22 |mm thick Ti foil. Product and beam nuclei were separated using 
288FL6c  the Transactinide Separator and Chemistry Apparatus (TASCA) based on   
288FL7c  magnetic rigidity. Evaporation residues were implanted into the focal  
288FL8c  plane detector consisting of two 300 |mm thick double sided silicon    
288FL9c  strip detectors (DSSSDs) after passing through a multiwire proportional
288FLAc  counter (MWPC). Two single sided silicon strip detectors (SSSSDs)      
288FLBc  mounted behind the DSSSDs to suppress light, low-ionizing particle     
288FLCc  detection and an additional eight SSSSDs were mounted upstream in a    
288FLDc  five-sided box configuration to detect alpha particles and SF fragments
288FLEc  escaping the DSSSDs. A Ge cluster detector with seven Ge crystals was  
288FLFc  mounted behind the Al backplate of the TASCA detection chamber for |a|g
288FLGc  coincidences. Measured EVR-|a, EVR-SF correlations; deduced half life,

288FL5c  detection of two atoms, one each assigned to {+288}Fl and {+289}Fl.    
288FL6c  The adsorption behavior of Fl and Cn isotopes was studied together with
288FL7c  their homologues Pb, Hg and Rn in groups 14 and 12 using isothermal gas
288FL8c  chromatography and thermochromatography techniques. The Fl atoms       
288FL9c  adsorbed on Au surface formed a metal-metal but indicated higher       
288FLAc  inertness compared to homologue Pb in the group. It was concluded      
288FLBc  that Fl is a volatile metal, the least reactive one in group 14, and   
288FLCc  not as inert as a noble gas.

288MC c  {B2009Dr05}: study of |a and SF decay events from a sample about two   
288MC2c  years after its formation to provide additional support for            
288MC3c  identification of Z=115 element in earlier studies at Dubna. Sample #4 
288MC4c  from those listed in 2005Dm03 was studied for |a- and SF-spectra, as it
288MC5c  contained the highest SF activity, after chemical treatment and        
288MC4c  preparation of the sample. A 4|p geometry was used to record |a- and   
288MC5c  SF-events as well as coincident neutrons. Long-term |a-counting of the 
288MC6c  sample was done in a 2|p geometry using PIPS |a detectors. No |a lines 
288MC8c  of heavy actinides such as {+252}Es, {+252}Cf, etc could be identified.
288MC9c  The SF activity was measured in a second arrangement using             
288MCAc  PIPS detectors in a 4|p counting geometry. No coincident high-energy   
288MCBc  events were recorded in this measurement, with an upper limit of       
288MCCc  0.00078 SF events per hour from long-lived actinides.                  
288MCDc  The presence of long-lived actinides in the |a spectrum was            
288MCEc  estimated using different prescriptions including multinucleon         
288MCFc  transfer cross sections for the following isotopes: Cm(A=240,242-246,  
288MCGc  248,250); Bk(A=242-249); Cf(A=246,248-250,252-256); Es(A=246,248,      
288MCHc  250,252-256); Fm(A=250,252-257); Md(A=254-260); No(A=254-257,259).     
288MCIc  In the measurement of the |a spectrum by 2009Dr05, 105 |a events       
288MCJc  between 5.72 and 5.84 MeV were attributed to the decay of {+243}Cm     
288MCKc  and {+244}Cm. From the measurement the SF rate was estimated as        
288MCLc  0.00046 events/hour in sample #4 immediately after its preparation.    
288MCMc  These long-term and two-year delayed measurements of the sample showed 
288MCNc  no evidence for SF decay events due to heavy actinides. A total of     
288MCOc  15 SF events observed in the experiment of 2005Og02 could be assigned  
288MCPc  to the decay products of {+288}Mc in the Rf/Db region, confirming the  
288MCQc  synthesis of Z=115 in 2004Og03 and 2005Og02.

288MC4c  {+48}Ca beam produced at E=247 MeV by the FLNR (JINR) U-400 cyclotron  
288MC5c  in June 2004. The beam bombarded a {+243}Am target backed by Ti foils  
288MC6c  and including Cu as a catcher material. Reaction products, including   
288MC7c  products of the Cu({+48}Ca,X) reaction were dissolved in concentrated  
288MC8c  HNO{-3}. Group V elements were separated from the solution by          
288MC9c  separating the reaction products from Cu via co-precipitation with     
288MCAc  lanthanum hydroxide and separating Group V elements from lanthanum and 
288MCBc  actinides via sorption from nitric acid. The |a particles and SF       
288MCCc  fragments were detected by a module with four identical chambers, each 
288MCDc  containing two semiconductor detectors. The four chambers were         
288MCEc  positioned inside a neutron detector containing 72 {+3}He counters     
288MCFc  positioned in a polyethylene moderator. A similar experiment was also  
288MCGc  performed, involving the same reaction but the reaction products were  
288MCHc  not separated. The detectors were exposed for 72 days, during which    
288MCIc  they were changed at intervals and subjected to physico-chemical       
288MCJc  treatment to develop latent tracks of spontaneous fission fragments.   
288MCKc  Deduced that all spontaneous fission events detected in the            
288MCLc  {+243}Am({+48}Ca,X) reaction were attributable to the decay chain of   
288MCMc  the element 115.

288MC8c  double-sided silicon strip detectors (DSSSD) and four additional       
288MC9c  16|*16-strip DSSSDs placed upstream. The |g rays were detected with Ge

288MCBc  decay chains (two EVR-|a-SF and five EVR-|a-|a-SF) were observed in    
288MCCc  this work. Authors analyzed the time correlation patterns, in contrast 
288MCDc  to number of |a chains, in their observed chains together with three   
288MCEc  short (EVR-|a-SF) decay chains (#9, #13 and #31 listed below) in       
288MCFc  the work of 2015Ga24 at Berkeley assigned as starting from {+288}Mc,   
288MCGc  and four short (EVR-|a-|a-SF) decay chains observed by 2013Og01 at     
288MCHc  Dubna but assigned as starting from {+289}Mc (see Table III on page 5  
288MCIc  in 2013Og01). 2016Fo10 proposed that these 14 short decay chains either
288MCJc  start from {+289}Mc or from {+288}Mc. Third possibility could be that  
288MCKc  some of these belong to {+288}Mc and the others to {+289}Mc. Based on  
288MCLc  comparison of time correlations, 2016Fo10 argued that all the 14 chains
288MCMc  could belong to {+288}Mc decay, but that further work was needed to    
288MCNc  elucidate the nature of the short decay chains. The authors analyzed,  
288MCOc  statistically, all the (96 or 107) decay chains observed at Dubna,     
288MCPc  GSI and Berkeley, and deduced averaged half-lives of {+288}Mc and its

288MC6c  electrodeposited on Ti foils. The Astatine isotopes with mass numbers  
288MC7c  198 to 201 were also produced at the same time for calibration purpose.
288MC8c  The fragments were separated using Berkeley Gas-filled separator (BGS) 
288MC9c  and then passed through FIONA (For the Identification Of Nuclide A)    
288MCAc  system consisting of a radiofrequency (rf) gas catcher, rf quadrupole  
288MCBc  (RFQ), RFQ trap, acceleration system where Mc{+1+} ions were           
288MCCc  accelerated to 3.319 keV, and a trochoidal mass analyzer. Finally the  
288MCDc  ions were implanted in a single-sided, 16-strip 2D-position-sensitive  
288MCEc  detector at the focal plan of FIONA apparatus, surrounded by 16-strip  
288MCFc  single-sided silicon detectors forming a five-sided cube. The          
288MCGc  trochoidal spectrometer was tuned for detection of ions, expected in   
288MCHc  1{++} charge state, for A/q=283-290. Measured |a|a-correlated events,  
288MCIc  A/q peak centroids, Lorentzian peak widths, and A/q dispersion.        
288MCJc  From the two events, following results were obtained:                  
288MCKc  The first event, observed with |a-|a correlations, corresponded        
288MCLc  to implantation of an ion with A/q=285, 284 or 283 with respective     
288MCMc  probabilities of 13%, 81% and 7%. The second event, observed with      
288MCNc  |a-|a-|a-|a correlations, corresponded to A/q=289, 288 or 287 with     
288MCOc  respective probabilities of 10%, 83% and 7%. Based on agreement of     
288MCPc  E|a values in |a-|a correlations in the present experiment with those  
288MCQc  reported in the previous experiments (at JINR-Dubna and GSI) where     
288MCRc  assignments were made to {+288}Mc, 2018Ga34 assigned both the events   
288MCSc  to the decay of {+288}Mc, and associated measured A/q value in the     
288MCTc  first event to {+284}Nh and in the second event to {+288}Mc, with      
288MCUc  a combined confidence level of 97.6%.
