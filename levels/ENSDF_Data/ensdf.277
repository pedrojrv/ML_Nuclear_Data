277  #c  Note that the TWG and JWP are primarily concerned with the priority of 
277  2c  discovery of an element and not a specific nuclide. The purpose of     
277  3c  this evaluation is to present the "best" set of nuclear properties     
277  4c  for those nuclides reported between A=266 and A=294 based on data      
277  5c  currently available and {Bnot} to establish a priority of discovery for
277  6c  any element.                                                           
277  !c                                                                         
277  #c  It is well known that alpha decay chains seen                          
277  ac  in cold fusion reactions tend to terminate in known mass regions.      
277  2c  The method of |a-|a or |a-SF correlations for identifying the          
277  3c  parent has therefore been used with confidence.                        
277  3c  Experiments carried out with hot fusion reactions,                     
277  4c  result in alpha decay chains beginning and ending with hitherto unknown
277  5c  nuclei, thereby necessitating the use of EVR-|a or EVR-SF correlations 
277  6c  in an attempt to identify the parent and daughters. The latter method  
277  7c  is not as accurate as the first since a greater probability of         
277  8c  randomness is inherant to the technique. As such, independent          
277  9c  verification and confirmation of the data gains added importance.      
277  ac  These facts should be taken into account when considering the suggested
277  ac  properties of nuclei created following a hot fusion reaction as for    
277  ac  the synthesis of Z=114 and above.                                      
277  #c                                                                         
277  #c  Finally, with regard to the some of the                                
277  ac  hot fusion studies conducted by the Dubna-Livermore collaboration,     
277  ac  2004Mo15 have pointed out that mass assignments which are based        
277  ac  on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus may be off by a       
277  ac  single unit. This may also be due in part to uncertainties in the beam 
277  ac  energy and calculated mass excesses of the expected super heavy nuclei.
277  ac  Once again, collateral information is required to establish the charge 
277  ac  and approximate A of the nucleus.                                      
277  #c                                                                         
277  @c  {U|DT{-1/2} Estimates:} Where the half-lives as given by the authors   
277  2c  have not been adopted, the evaluators have used the approximations in  
277  3c  equation 18 of 1984Sc13 for three or more events, assuming an          
277  4c  exponential distribution to estimate the standard uncertainty (68%     
277  5c  confidence level) in T{-1/2}:

277  8c  t{-m}=average mean time, z=1 for a 68% confidence level, and n=number  
277  9c  of events. For one and two events, the exact values given in Table 1   
277  Ac  have been used: |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.543 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=5.79 for n=1 and   
277  Bc  |t{-l}/t{-m}=0.606 and |t{-u}/t{-m}=2.82 for n=2. Note that except for 
277  Cc  the one event |t{-u}/t{-m}, the approximations are accurate within 10%.

277  #c  The parameters were obtained by a fit to 65 even-even nuclei with Z>82 
277  2c  and N>126 (2004OgZZ). Values are revised here in accordance with the   
277  3c  parameter set used in these evaluations. We note that these systematics
277  6c  are only an indication of |a-decay half-lives from the ground state    
277  7c  of a given even-Z(parent), rather than specific to any isotope of the  
277  8c  the element under consideration. The use of this formalism in the      
277  ac  case of odd and odd-odd nuclei is to be taken as qualitative. Some     
277  ac  experimenters ({Ie.g.}, 2004OG03) use T{-1/2}(calc) so derived to      
277  ac  estimate a Hindrance Factor (HF) for a given transition,               
277  ac  attributable to the odd neutron or proton. This quantity is            
277  ac  then given by the ratio of  T|a(expt) to T|a(calc).                    
277  ac  The HF so computed is an approximate indication.

277  @c  {UFusion-Fission Dynamics:} An emerging topic of interest in the       
277  2c  trans-fermium elements is the manifestation of shell effects in the    
277  3c  mass energy distributions (MED) of heavy nuclei as reflected in their  
277  4c  fission and quasi-fission (QF) signatures. Studies of this type are    
277  5c  important as QF is expected to play a greater role on the hindrance of 
277  6c  fusion as one attempts to synthesis heavier nuclei in the approach to  
277  7c  the "island" of stability. An understanding of this mechanism is       
277  8c  necessary to establishing the most favorable reactions for producing   
277  9c  heavy elements. Another unexpected hindrance to fusion was discovered  
277  Ac  by the Canberra group (1998Da24) in much lighter, asymmetric systems   
277  Bc  leading to the formation of CN {+216}Ra*. This was found to be related 
277  Cc  to both the mass asymmetry in the entrance channel as well as the      
277  Dc  on-set of QF. It is thought that (closed) shell structure, as well as  
277  Ec  deformations of target/projectile nuclei and their relative orientation
277  Fc  to each other in the process of CN formation, may also play an         
277  Gc  important role in reducing the probability of forming a compound       
277  Hc  system. In the face of extremely low yields and a steep decrease of    
277  Ic  production cross-sections already in evidence with available stable    
277  Jc  beam-target combinations, the influence of all possible mitigating     
277  Kc  factors must be accurately determined in order to                      
277  Lc  optimize the probability of successful fusion. The formation of a      
277  Mc  super-heavy element (SHE) will be possible only if the di-nucleus      
277  Nc  survives QF going on to form a compact compound system which must then 
277  Oc  face competition from fission.

277  #c  Recently (2004PrZW), a series of experiments designed to investigate   
277  2c  fusion-fission dynamics have been carried out at FLNR-JINR in Dubna    
277  3c  in collaboration with investigators from Belgium, France, and Italy.   
277  4c  Nascent compound nuclei were formed in the range Z=102-122 in the      
277  5c  reactions {+26}Mg+{+248}Cm; {+48}Ca with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+238}U,  
277  6c  {+244}Pu, and {+248}Cm; and {+58}Fe with {+208}Pb, {+232}Th, {+244}Pu, 
277  7c  and {+248}Cm using the U400 cyclotron and the double-arm tof           
277  8c  spectrometer "Corset". These experiments were inspired by              
277  9c  the use of similar targets in the synthesis of Z=112, Z=114, and Z=116 
277  Ac  at Dubna. QF was observed in nuclei {+286}112 to {+296}116 and

277  2c  Two possibilities have been proposed in an attempt to understand the   
277  ac  the {+289}114, {+287}114 observations:                                 
277  #c  (i) that the single {+289}114 chain seen by the DGFRS group            
277  ac  belongs to a rare decay mode originating from                          
277  4c  an isomeric state, or that                                             
277  #c  (ii) the sequence may actually originate from                          
277  6c  {+290}114|){+286}112|){+282}Ds|){+278}Hs (SF) (See {+290}114 Adopted

277  #c  The evaluators believe that further investigations                     
277  ac  are required to support either hypothesis.                             
277  #c  Thus, {+290}114, {+286}112, {+282}Ds and {+278}Hs remain

277  Ac  for {+287}114 as seen by 1999Og07 (data from the VASSILISSA separator)

277  #c  Note that the two papers, 2004Og12 and 2004OgZZ are identical in many

277  #c  2000Ar03, who analyzed the data for the 34-min decay chain of {+289}114
277  3c  (DGFRS data from 1999Og10), {+287}114, and the SF events reported      
277  ac  for {+283}112 (VASSILISSA data from 1999Og05 and 1999Og07),            
277  4c  classified the evidence as being "very weak",                          
277  5c  with no convincing supporting arguments for the possible production of 
277  6c  SHE. We make the following general observations:                       
277  #c                                                                         
277  #c  A total of 46 events (Table IV, 2004Og12), with 5 more events bringing 
277  ac  the total to 51 decays (Table V: 2004OgZZ), have since been reported   
277  ac  by the Dubna-JINR collaborations for all isotopes of                   
277  2c  Z=114. From the largest number of events as reported in  2004OgZZ,     
277  ac  the isotopes observed are {+289}114 (9 events), {+288}114 (16 events), 
277  ac  {+287}114 (15 events) and {+286}114                                    
277  4c  (11 |a + 5 SF events). Taking all the data into consideration,         
277  ac  the |?34 min decay sequence postulated as originating from             
277  5c  a rare decay mode of {+289}114, does not seem very likely.             
277  6c  On the other hand, a statistical analysis by 2000Zl02 suggests that the
277  7c  {+289}114 decays observed are genetically linked                       
277  8c  and not the result of a background decay sequence. These               
277  BC  discrepancies have to be resolved, along with some others.             
277  #c                                                                         
277  #c  {+283}112: The six SF events reported {Ivia} 1999Og05 and 1999Og07 have
277  ac  (see also 2004Og02) with VASSILISSA, have not                          
277  2c  been reproduced in experiments done with DGFRS. There appears to be a  
277  3c  lack of internal consistency through the collective measurements       
277  ac  and the data are inconclusive as pointed                               
277  4c  out by experimenters (reasons given in each paper). Decay properties of
277  5c  parent {+287}114 may be similar to those noted in 2004Og12 but those   
277  6c  of the daughter {+283}112 differ. Also, 2005Gr19 and 2002Lo15 reported 
277  7c  no SF decays or EVR-|a-|a correlations with |Dt(EVR-|a)<20 s or        
277  8c  |Dt(|a-|a)<20 s in any of the {+48}Ca + {+238}U irradiations performed 
277  8c  by them. See {+283}112 Adopted Levels for details.

277  #c  These observations by the experimenters are consistent with the        
277  2c  findings of 2000Ar03 which offer a more detailed analysis. However,    
277  3c  of the various arguments put

277  #c                                                                         
277  #c  1. Total TKE's from the two presumed Z=112 fragments are in each case: 
277  #c  190 MeV and 212 MeV (1999Og05)                                         
277  #c  65 MeV and 170 MeV  (2004Og02)                                         
277  #c  195 MeV and 165 MeV (1999Og07: Daughters of {+287}114)                 
277  #c  TKE for Z=112 (2004Og12; {+282}112 observed as daughter in four events 
277  2c  of nine attributed to {+286}114 (Page 8, Table II(c)) is measured at   
277  3c  213 MeV and 211 MeV (two events, # 1 & 9, registered in both focal     
277  4c  plane and side detectors). With one exception, all the energies        
277  5c  measured in the three papers (1999Og05, 1999Og07, and 2004Og02)        
277  6c  are, in fact, lower than would be expected for this mass range (Z=112  
277  7c  or Hs) as pointed out in 2000Ar03. However, a direct mass analysis     
277  8c  undertaken by the experimenters (2004OG02) of the two SF nuclei (from  
277  9c  the second experiment) after EVR implantation resulted in              
277  ac  A=285.1 {I41}. The result is in agreement with EVR's produced in       
277  bc  {+48}Ca+{+238}U|){+286}112*.

277  #c  2. 2000Ar03 statement that correlations  between the fission events    
277  2c  and preceding signals (recoils/|a's) are random.  Note that a          
277  3c  'backward' analysis of the data was reported in                        
277  4c  1999Og07 and in the other papers. These statements by 2000Ar03 are     
277  5c  evidently in contradiction with those made by the                      
277  6c  experimenters. A more complete analysis would be beneficial.           
277  #c                                                                         
277  #c  3. The experimenters rely on two Z=114 chains (one measured in the     
277  2c  1999Og07); the |?34 min sequence tentatively attributed to {+289}114   
277  ac  quoted from an earlier                                                 
277  3c  experiment (and not seen since) is invoked in support of daughter Z=112
277  4c  assignments. The proposed assignment of Z=114 to both parents may      
277  5c  be incorrect taking into account new data which do not support         
277  6c  these observations and for reasons already mentioned.                  
277  7c  Hence, the Z=112 daughter is also possibly incorrect.                  
277  !c                                                                         
277  #c  CONCLUSIONS:                                                           
277  #c  Properties of Z=112 as proposed in 1999Og05, 1999Og07 and 2004Og02

277  2c  results from the VASSILISSA experiments are at variance with data from 
277  3c  experiments using DGFRS. The latter investigations are done using      
277  4c  more stringent methods, and have greater statistics, offering better   
277  5c  internal consistency. Some obvious discrepancies and other             
277  ac  inconsistencies between the two sets of                                
277  6c  data remain and need to be resolved or adequately explained as does the

277HS4c  {+244}Pu({+48}Ca,3n),E=259.4 MeV at GSI facility                       
277HS c  Evidence for an isomer in {+277}Hs is provided by 2012Ho12 from        
277HS2c  |a decay of a state in {+281}Ds of very different half-life than       
277HS3c  in previous studies. Reaction used was {+248}Cm({+48}Ca,3n),E=265.4 MeV
277HS4c  using velocity filter SHIP of GSI facility. The observed |a-decay      
277HS5c  chains were: {+293}Lv -> {+289}Fl -> {+285}Cn -> {+281}Ds -> {+277}Hs; 
277HS6c  terminating in SF decay of {+277}Hs. From |a decay of {+281}Ds, two    
277HS7c  |a-particle energies of 8727 keV and 9315 keV were observed with       
277HS8c  very different half-lives, suggesting an isomer in {+281}Ds, as well   
277HS9c  as in {+277}Hs

277HS c  Earlier unconfirmed reports about the identification of {+277}Hs:      
277HS2c  2000Fi12 evaluation tentatively adopted the Dubna data for {+289}114   
277HS3c  produced in {+244}Pu({+48}Ca,3n) as reported by 1999GhZZ (see 1999Og10,
277HS4c  2000Og07 and 2001Og11). The one chain of |a events culminating in the  
277HS5c  SF decay of {+277}Hs was reassigned to {+290}114 by 2004Og10.          
277HS6c  Subsequent decay chains assigned to {+289}114 terminated with the SF   
277HS7c  decay of {+281}Ds. It would seem that 2004Mo15 summarized data for two 
277HS8c  {+289}114 chains prior to their reassignment by 2004Og10. Thus, the two
277HS9c  events attributed by 2004Mo15 to {+277}Hs terminating the sequence     
277HSAc  should also be reassigned. In 2005Gu33 evaluation, {+277}Hs nuclide was
277HSBc  labeled as unobserved

277DS c  2010El06: first identification of {+277}Ds nuclide in the |a-decay     
277DS2c  chain of {+285}Fl nuclide. The {+285}Fl nuclide was produced in        
277DS3c  {+242}Pu({+48}Ca,5n) at E=256 MeV from LBNL cyclotron facility.        
277DS4c  Evaporation residues were separated by BGS based on magnetic           
277DS5c  rigidities. Signals from multiwire proportional counters (MWPC) and    
277DS6c  focal plane detector (FPD) were used to distinguish implantation events
277DS7c  from radioactive decay events in the FPD. Z=114 events were identified 
277DS9c  by detecting time and position correlated events corresponding to their
277DSAc  implantation and subsequent radioactive decay chain terminating in     
277DSBc  SF decay of {+265}Rf.

277DS8c  were separated from the incident beam ions, scattered particles, and   
277DS9c  transfer reaction products by the DGFRS based on magnetic rigidities.  
277DSAc  Recoils passed through a tof system of two multiwire proportional

277DSCc  (0.3-mm thick double-sided silicon strip detectors) placed at the      
277DSDc  final focus of the DGFRS. Events related to Z=114 were identified by   
277DSEc  detecting time and position correlated events corresponding to their   
277DSFc  implantation and subsequent |a-decay chain terminating in SF decay.

277DS5c  confirmed in a repeated experiment at LBNL (2003Gr26). Also, 2001MoZU

277DS8c  (2000HoZZ). The statistical analysis by 2000Sc26 indicated that the    
277DS9c  data of 1999Ni03 did not originate from radioactive decays with an     
277DSAc  error probability of less than 5%.

277CN4C  AND 343.8 MEV (^E*=10.1 MEV; SIGMA<2.6 pb; 0 EVENTS). ^E*=12.0 MEV WAS 
277CN5C  EXPECTED TO BE THE MAXIMUM CROSS-SECTION. THE TOTAL BEAM DOSE WAS      
277CN6C  3.5E+18 IONS. ONE NEW ALPHA DECAY CHAIN WAS MEASURED ON MAY 5{+th},    
277CN7C  2000 AT A DEDUCED CROSS-SECTION OF 0.5 pb {I+11-4}. THIS NEW CHAIN ENDS
277CN8C  AT 261RF BY A PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN SF BRANCH. NO NEW DECAY SEQUENCE WAS  
277CN9C  OBSERVED WHEN THE EXPERIMENT WAS REPEATED AT THE LOWER ENERGY OF 343.8 
277CNAC  MEV AS EMPLOYED IN THE 1996HO13. A REANALYSIS OF RAW DATA FROM THE     
277CNBC  FIRST EXPERIMENT REVEALED INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE BINARY FILES     
277CNCC  STORED AND THE EVENT-BY-EVENT TEXT FILES, ON THE BASIS OF WHICH        
277CNDC  PRELIMINARY ASSIGNMENTS WERE MADE IN THE CASE OF THE FIRST DECAY CHAIN 
277CNEC  (FEBRUARY 1, 1996). THE CHAIN WAS FOUND TO BE SPURIOUS AND WAS         
277CNFC  RETRACTED. A  REVISED MEAN VALUE FOR THE CROSS-SECTION OF THE DATA     
277CNGC  POINT AT ^E*=10.1 MEV IS 0.4 pb {I+9-3}. THE THIRD CHAIN (CURRENT WORK)
277CNHC  IS IN AGREEMENT WITH DATA FROM THE SECOND CHAIN OF 1996HO13            
277CNIC  (FEBRUARY 9, 1996):

277CN C  2004MOZU: CONFIRMATORY EXPERIMENTS PERFORMED BY THE Japanese GROUP     
277CN2C  AT ^RIKEN USING THE REACTION 208PB(70ZN,N). THE BEAM PROVIDED BY       
277CN3C  ^RILAC HAD AN ENERGY OF 349.5 MEV 6 CORRESPONDING TO 345.9 MEV AT      
277CN4C  TARGET CENTER. TYPICAL BEAM INTENSITY ON TARGET WAS 1.7E+12/S WITH A   
277CN5C  TOTAL BEAM DOSE OF 4.4E+18 IONS. 16 TARGETS WERE MOUNTED ON A WHEEL    
277CN6C  30 CM IN DIAMETER ROTATING AT 2000 RPM. THE REACTION PRODUCTS WERE     
277CN7C  SEPARATED BY HE-FILLED ^GARIS AND GUIDED INTO A DETECTOR MODULE.       
277CN8C  ASSUMING AN 80% TRANSMISSION EFFICIENCY FOR ^GARIS, THE PRODUCTION     
277CN9C  CROSS-SECTION WAS DEDUCED TO BE 0.44 pb {I+59-29}. TWO EVENTS WERE

277CN C  ASSIGNMENT: 208PB(70ZN,N) E=343.8 MEV (1996HO13), 346.1 MEV (2002HO11),
277CN2C  345.9 MEV (2004MOZU). THE DECAY PROPERTIES OF THE ONE CHAIN REPORTED BY
277CN3C  1996HO13, ONE CHAIN REPORTED BY 2002HO11, AND THE TWO CHAINS REPORTED  
277CN4C  2004MOZU ARE CONSISTENT AND ARE ALSO IN AGREEMENT WITH THE PROPERTIES  
277CN5C  OF THE THREE 269HS CHAINS REPORTED BY 2003TU05 (248CM(26MG,5N)         
277CN6C  E=143.7-146.8 MEV; CHEM). DECAY PROPERTIES OF THESE SEVEN CHAINS ALSO  
277CN7C  APPEAR CONSISTENT WITH LITERATURE DATA FOR 265SG BUT NOT FOR 261RF.    
277CN8C  COMPARING THEIR DATA, THAT OF 1996HO13, AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM   
277CN9C  2003TU05 TO THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE DATA, 2002HO11 CONCLUDE THAT TWO  
277CNAC  STATES EXIST IN 261RF WITH T'S OF 78 S +11-6 AND 4.2 S +34-13. THE     
277CNBC  FIRST STATE DECAYS BY A 8.28-MEV ALPHA AND THE SECOND, BY 8.52-MEV     
277CNCC  ALPHA EMISSION AND SPONTANEOUS FISSION (AP 40%). BASED ON A PRIVATE    
277CNDC  COMMUNICATION FROM ^A.^H. Wapstra, 2002HO11 SUGGEST THAT THE 8.52-MEV  
277CNEC  ALPHA FITS BETTER THE SYSTEMATICS OF GROUND-STATE ALPHA ENERGIES AND,  
277CNFC  THEREFORE, TENTATIVELY ASSIGN THE 4.2-S STATE AS THE GROUND STATE AND  
277CNGC  THE 78-S STATE COULD BE A HIGHER SPIN ISOMER SINCE THESE ARE           
277CNHC  PREFERENTIALLY PRODUCED IN HEAVY-ION FUSION REACTIONS. THE DATA OF     
277CNIC  2004MOZU TEND TO SUPPORT THESE CONCLUSIONS ALTHOUGH THE ESTIMATE OF THE
277CNJC  FISSION BRANCHING RATIO MAY INCREASE. IN THE 273DS CHAIN REPORTED BY   
277CNKC  1996LA12 (244PU(34S,5N) E=190 MEV), 269HS WAS NOT OBSERVED AND THE     
277CNLC  LIFETIMES OF 265SG AND 261RF SEEM UNUSUALLY LONG. WHILE THERE MAY      
277CNMC  STILL BE PROBLEMS WITH 261RF, THE 277CN DECAY CHAIN SEEMS TO BE WELL
