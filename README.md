This repository contains tutorials and working code needed to tackle a complete end-to-end nuclear data evaluation. It is used by `NucML`, the first and only end-to-end python-based supervised machine learning pipeline for enhanced bias-free nuclear data generation and evaluation to support the advancement of next-generation nuclear systems. It offers capabilities that allow researchers to navigate through each step of the ML-based nuclear data cross section evaluation pipeline. Some of the supported activities include include dataset parsing and compilation of reaction data, exploratory data analysis, data manipulation, and feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and validation via criticality benchmarks. 

While NucML was originally designed to provide utilities to navigate the ML-augmented Nuclear Data Evaluation Pipeline, it is our vision to expand and modernize other aspects of the industry. 

# Installation and Setup

Please visit the `NucML` documentation for instructions on installation and setup.

# How to Use this Repository

The NucML documentation provides the best way to interact with the material in this repository, however, each directory contains a `README.md` file that explains the directories structure and content description for the contained files. Most jupyter notebooks are written in a way that explains the procedures and techniques being taken.
