This repository contains tutorials and working code needed to tackle a complete end-to-end nuclear data evaluation. It is used by `NucML`, the first and only end-to-end python-based supervised machine learning pipeline for enhanced bias-free nuclear data generation and evaluation to support the advancement of next-generation nuclear systems.


# How to Use this Repository

The NucML documentation provides the best way to interact with the material in this repository, however, each directory contains a `README.md` file that explains the directories structure and content description for the contained files. Most jupyter notebooks are written in a way that explains the procedures and techniques being taken. Please visit the `NucML` documentation for instructions on installation and setup.
